[sos] i'm doing great. what about you? [eos]
[sos] i'm absolutely lovely, thank you. [eos]
[sos] everything's been good with you? [eos]
[sos] i haven't been better. how about yourself? [eos]
[sos] i started school recently. [eos]
[sos] where are you going to school? [eos]
[sos] i'm going to pcc. [eos]
[sos] how do you like it so far? [eos]
[sos] i like it so far. my classes are pretty good right now. [eos]
[sos] i wish you luck. [eos]
[sos] i know. i think it may rain. [eos]
[sos] it's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today. [eos]
[sos] that would be weird. [eos]
[sos] yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside. [eos]
[sos] i know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside. [eos]
[sos] yes, it would be. [eos]
[sos] i really wish it wasn't so hot every day. [eos]
[sos] me too. i can't wait until winter. [eos]
[sos] i like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold. [eos]
[sos] i'd rather be cold than hot. [eos]
[sos] me too. [eos]
[sos] you're right. i think it's going to rain later. [eos]
[sos] in the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining. [eos]
[sos] that wouldn't seem right. [eos]
[sos] considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird. [eos]
[sos] exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. it's too hot. [eos]
[sos] i know, you're absolutely right. [eos]
[sos] i wish it would cool off one day. [eos]
[sos] that's how i feel, i want winter to come soon. [eos]
[sos] i enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes. [eos]
[sos] i know what you mean, but i'd rather be cold than hot. [eos]
[sos] that's exactly how i feel. [eos]
[sos] that is true. i hope it doesn't rain. [eos]
[sos] it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer. [eos]
[sos] it wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now. [eos]
[sos] it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather. [eos]
[sos] any rain right now would be pointless. [eos]
[sos] that's right, it really would be. [eos]
[sos] i want it to cool down some. [eos]
[sos] i know what you mean, i can't wait until it's winter. [eos]
[sos] winter is great. i wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though. [eos]
[sos] i would rather deal with the winter than the summer. [eos]
[sos] yes, it is. [eos]
[sos] it looks like it may rain soon. [eos]
[sos] yes, and i hope that it does. [eos]
[sos] why is that? [eos]
[sos] i really love how rain clears the air. [eos]
[sos] me too. it always smells so fresh after it rains. [eos]
[sos] yes, but i love the night air after it rains. [eos]
[sos] really? why is it? [eos]
[sos] because you can see the stars perfectly. [eos]
[sos] i really hope it rains today. [eos]
[sos] yeah, me too. [eos]
[sos] it really is. [eos]
[sos] it seems that it may rain today. [eos]
[sos] hopefully it will. [eos]
[sos] how come? [eos]
[sos] i like how clear the sky gets after it rains. [eos]
[sos] i feel the same way. it smells so good after it rains. [eos]
[sos] i especially love the night air when it rains. [eos]
[sos] really? why? [eos]
[sos] the stars look so much closer after it rains. [eos]
[sos] i really want it to rain today. [eos]
[sos] yeah, so do i. [eos]
[sos] yes, i think so too. [eos]
[sos] i think that it's going to rain. [eos]
[sos] i hope that it does rain. [eos]
[sos] you like the rain? [eos]
[sos] the sky looks so clean after it rains. i love it. [eos]
[sos] i understand. rain does make it smell cleaner. [eos]
[sos] i love most how it is at night after it rains. [eos]
[sos] how come? [eos]
[sos] you can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains. [eos]
[sos] i would love for it to rain today. [eos]
[sos] that sounds like fun. what's the weather going to be like? [eos]
[sos] i heard that it's going to be warm this weekend. [eos]
[sos] is it going to be perfect beach weather? [eos]
[sos] i believe so. [eos]
[sos] good. i hope it doesn't cool off this weekend. [eos]
[sos] i know. i really want to go to the beach. [eos]
[sos] but you know that california weather is really unpredictable. [eos]
[sos] you're right. one minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold. [eos]
[sos] i really wish the weather would just stay the same. [eos]
[sos] i do too. that way we can have our activities planned ahead of time. [eos]
[sos] yeah, that would make things a lot easier. [eos]
[sos] a trip to the beach would be fun. how is the weather going to be? [eos]
[sos] the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend. [eos]
[sos] so do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach? [eos]
[sos] it sounds like it will be. [eos]
[sos] i really hope it doesn't get cold. [eos]
[sos] that would ruin things, i want to go so badly. [eos]
[sos] the weather in california is unpredictable, so you never know. [eos]
[sos] that is true. the weather is constantly changing. [eos]
[sos] it would be nice if the weather would never change. [eos]
[sos] that would be great, then we could plan things sooner. [eos]
[sos] true. predictable weather would make life easier. [eos]
[sos] what's the weather going to be like? i may want to go too. [eos]
[sos] the weather this weekend is supposed to be warm. [eos]
[sos] will it be good beach weather? [eos]
[sos] i think it will be. [eos]
[sos] it wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend. [eos]
[sos] i want this trip to be perfect, i hope it stays warm. [eos]
[sos] this california weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen. [eos]
[sos] i know. every day the weather seems different. [eos]
[sos] i would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable. [eos]
[sos] that would make it easier for us to make plans. [eos]
[sos] this is she. how's it going? [eos]
[sos] i've been trying to call you all day. [eos]
[sos] sorry about that. i was cleaning up. [eos]
[sos] it's okay. [eos]
[sos] so what were you calling me about? [eos]
[sos] oh, i just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow. [eos]
[sos] sure, what did you want to do? [eos]
[sos] maybe we can go see a movie or something. [eos]
[sos] that sounds like fun. let's do it. [eos]
[sos] i'll see you tomorrow then. [eos]
[sos] see you then. goodbye. [eos]
[sos] speaking. what's up? [eos]
[sos] why haven't you answered the phone? [eos]
[sos] my bad, i had chores to do. [eos]
[sos] that's all right. [eos]
[sos] what was the reason for your call? [eos]
[sos] i want to do something tomorrow with you. [eos]
[sos] sounds good. what did you have in mind? [eos]
[sos] i was thinking about seeing a movie. [eos]

[sos] i would say she's only five feet. [eos]
[sos] what about her facial features? [eos]
[sos] she has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful. [eos]

[sos] that's sad, but have you gone to the movies recently? [eos]
[sos] that's a switch. [eos]
[sos] i'm serious, have you? [eos]
[sos] no, i haven't. why? [eos]
[sos] i really want to go to the movies this weekend. [eos]
[sos] so go then. [eos]
[sos] i really don't want to go by myself. [eos]
[sos] well anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow? [eos]
[sos] no, i think i'm going to go to the movies. [eos]
[sos] i always do. did you go to school today? [eos]
[sos] no, i didn't. [eos]
[sos] you should have, but have you seen any movies lately? [eos]
[sos] that was an odd change of subject. [eos]
[sos] maybe it was, but answer the question. [eos]
[sos] no, not recently. [eos]
[sos] i want to go to see a movie this weekend. [eos]
[sos] what's stopping you then? [eos]
[sos] i don't want to go alone. [eos]

[sos] no, i want to go to the movies instead. [eos]
[sos] yeah, i went. did you go? [eos]
[sos] no, i didn't feel like it. [eos]
[sos] that's nice, have you been to the movies lately? [eos]
[sos] no, but that was a random change of subject. [eos]
[sos] it may have been random, but have you? [eos]
[sos] i haven't lately. [eos]
[sos] i would love to catch a movie this weekend. [eos]
[sos] so then, why don't you just go? [eos]

[sos] is it in northern california? [eos]
[sos] no. it's in southern california. [eos]
[sos] is pasadena a big city? [eos]
[sos] it's pretty big. [eos]
[sos] how big is "pretty big"? [eos]
[sos] it has about 140,000 people. [eos]
[sos] how big is los angeles? [eos]
[sos] it has about 3 million people. [eos]
[sos] yes, i do. [eos]
[sos] what kind of car do you have? [eos]
[sos] i have a honda. [eos]

[sos] it was new in 2003. [eos]
[sos] so, it's pretty old now. [eos]

[sos] do you take good care of it? [eos]
[sos] oh, yes. i wash it once a week. [eos]
[sos] do you change the oil? [eos]
[sos] my mechanic changes the oil twice a year. [eos]
[sos] no, i don't. do you? [eos]
[sos] i don't have a girlfriend, either. [eos]

[sos] i don't know. maybe i'm not rich enough. [eos]
[sos] girls like guys with money. [eos]
[sos] they sure do. [eos]
[sos] they like guys with new cars. [eos]
[sos] i don't have money or a new car. [eos]
[sos] me, neither. [eos]
[sos] but girls like guys who are funny. [eos]
[sos] maybe we should learn some good jokes. [eos]
[sos] i have to walk the dog. [eos]
[sos] what kind of dog do you have? [eos]
[sos] i have a little poodle. [eos]
[sos] poodles bark a lot. [eos]
[sos] they sure do. [eos]
[sos] they bark at everything. [eos]
[sos] they never shut up. [eos]
[sos] why did you get a poodle? [eos]
[sos] it's my mom's dog. [eos]
[sos] so she likes poodles. [eos]
[sos] she says they're good watchdogs. [eos]
[sos] sure. why do you need it? [eos]
[sos] i want to buy lunch. [eos]
[sos] where's your money? [eos]
[sos] it's not in my wallet. [eos]
[sos] your wallet is empty? [eos]
[sos] i don't have even one dollar in it. [eos]
[sos] being broke is no fun. [eos]
[sos] even if it's only for a short while. [eos]
[sos] it's always good to have friends. [eos]
[sos] friends will lend you money when you're broke. [eos]
[sos] as long as you pay them back. [eos]
[sos] that's a great idea. [eos]
[sos] we haven't been in a while. [eos]
[sos] we haven't been in a month. [eos]
[sos] the last time we went, you almost drowned. [eos]
[sos] no, i didn't. [eos]
[sos] then why did the lifeguard dive into the water? [eos]
[sos] i think he wanted to cool off. [eos]
[sos] he swam right up to you. [eos]
[sos] and then he turned right around. [eos]
[sos] maybe you're right. [eos]
[sos] maybe we should get going. [eos]
[sos] no. i'm divorced. [eos]
[sos] when did you get divorced? [eos]
[sos] i got divorced two years ago. [eos]
[sos] why did you get divorced? [eos]
[sos] my wife left me. [eos]
[sos] why did she leave you? [eos]
[sos] she said she didn't love me anymore. [eos]
[sos] wow! that's terrible. [eos]
[sos] yes, it was. [eos]
[sos] why didn't she love you anymore? [eos]
[sos] she fell in love with my best friend. [eos]
[sos] what's on tv? [eos]
[sos] nothing. [eos]
[sos] there must be something on tv! [eos]
[sos] nothing that's interesting. [eos]
[sos] what about that new game show? [eos]
[sos] which one? [eos]
[sos] "deal or no deal" [eos]
[sos] tell me you're joking. [eos]
[sos] i love that show. [eos]
[sos] i watched it once. that was enough. [eos]
[sos] it's on right now. let's watch it together. [eos]
[sos] i agree. pasadena is a nice city. [eos]
[sos] it's not too big. [eos]
[sos] and it's not too small. [eos]
[sos] it has great weather all year long. [eos]
[sos] it has the rose parade. [eos]
[sos] it has beautiful houses. [eos]
[sos] it has wonderful restaurants. [eos]
[sos] it has great schools. [eos]
[sos] it's close to the mountains. [eos]
[sos] the people are friendly. [eos]
[sos] i'm not ever going to leave. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter with this one? [eos]
[sos] it's not comfortable. [eos]
[sos] it seems fine to me. [eos]
[sos] i toss and turn all night. [eos]
[sos] you should stop drinking coffee. [eos]
[sos] look at these marks on my arms. [eos]
[sos] what are they? [eos]
[sos] they are bites. [eos]
[sos] did the cat bite you? [eos]
[sos] no. the bedbugs in that mattress bit me. [eos]
[sos] okay. let's get a new mattress. [eos]
[sos] buy a new one. [eos]
[sos] i would if i had the money. [eos]
[sos] why is it so slow? [eos]
[sos] that's a good question. [eos]
[sos] did you take it to a computer shop? [eos]
[sos] i would if i had the money. [eos]
[sos] well, i guess you have to live with it. [eos]
[sos] sometimes i want to throw it out the window. [eos]
[sos] you don't want to do that. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] you might hit someone in the head. [eos]
[sos] i'm not sure. [eos]
[sos] how about a pizza? [eos]
[sos] you had pizza for lunch. [eos]
[sos] but i love pizza. [eos]
[sos] everybody loves pizza. [eos]
[sos] so why can't i have pizza for dinner? [eos]
[sos] because you need variety. [eos]
[sos] what's "variety? [eos]
[sos] different thingsnot the same thing all the time. [eos]
[sos] you mean, like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza? [eos]
[sos] no, i mean a salad instead of a pizza. [eos]
[sos] why do we need to save money? [eos]
[sos] because we need to buy a house. [eos]
[sos] but a house is so expensive. [eos]
[sos] that's why we need to save money. [eos]
[sos] how much do we need to save? [eos]
[sos] we need to save enough for a down payment. [eos]
[sos] how much is that? [eos]
[sos] that's about $30,000. [eos]
[sos] thirty thousand dollars! that will take forever. [eos]
[sos] not if we save every penny. [eos]
[sos] okay. here's seven pennies. [eos]
[sos] you can't see the end of it. [eos]
[sos] it goes on and on forever. [eos]
[sos] and it's deep, too. [eos]
[sos] i think it's five miles deep. [eos]
[sos] are there fish at the bottom? [eos]
[sos] there are fish at the top and the bottom. [eos]
[sos] are there more fish or more people? [eos]
[sos] i think there are more fish. [eos]
[sos] i hope so. i love to eat fish. [eos]
[sos] why is that? [eos]
[sos] i warned her about her new boyfriend. she didn't listen to me. [eos]
[sos] what happened? [eos]
[sos] i gave her $1,000 for her birthday. i told her to spend it on herself. [eos]
[sos] that was very nice of you. [eos]
[sos] i found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend. [eos]
[sos] why did she do that? [eos]
[sos] he said he would buy her a nice ring. [eos]
[sos] what's wrong with that? [eos]
[sos] he went to las vegas. he lost it all gambling. [eos]
[sos] i hope your mom broke up with him. [eos]
[sos] of course they talk to each other. [eos]
[sos] what do they talk about? [eos]
[sos] they talk about other animals. [eos]
[sos] what else do they talk about? [eos]
[sos] they talk about food and the weather. [eos]
[sos] do they talk about us? [eos]
[sos] of course they talk about us. [eos]
[sos] what do they say about us? [eos]
[sos] they say that we are funny-looking. [eos]
[sos] ha! we're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking. [eos]
[sos] we're funny-looking because we wear clothes. [eos]
[sos] yes, it's very dirty. [eos]
[sos] you can help me. [eos]
[sos] why me? [eos]
[sos] because you helped make it dirty. [eos]
[sos] what do you want me to do? [eos]
[sos] i want you to clean the bathroom. [eos]
[sos] oh, that's easy. [eos]
[sos] clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet. [eos]
[sos] that's a lot of work. [eos]
[sos] tell me when you finish. [eos]
[sos] i don't think so. you'll just give me more work. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] i mean you're wasting your life. [eos]
[sos] i'm having fun. [eos]
[sos] you're sitting there with your mouth open. [eos]
[sos] who cares? [eos]
[sos] i care. do something. [eos]
[sos] okay. i did something. [eos]
[sos] what did you do? [eos]
[sos] i turned up the volume. [eos]
[sos] that's not what i meant by "do something." [eos]
[sos] will you do something? leave me alone. [eos]
[sos] yes, i did. [eos]
[sos] did you tell her about school? [eos]
[sos] i told her that school is fun. [eos]
[sos] did you put the letter in an envelope? [eos]
[sos] yes, and i sealed the envelope. [eos]
[sos] did you put a stamp on the envelope? [eos]
[sos] i couldn't find any stamps. [eos]
[sos] they're in the kitchen drawer. [eos]
[sos] okay. i just put a stamp on the envelope. [eos]
[sos] give me the envelope, and i'll mail it for you. [eos]
[sos] when is grandma going to learn about e-mail? [eos]
[sos] i'm sleepy. [eos]
[sos] why don't you go to bed? [eos]
[sos] i want to watch this tv show. [eos]
[sos] maybe you should record it. [eos]
[sos] the tape recorder is broken. [eos]
[sos] then you should watch the rerun. [eos]
[sos] why? i'm watching the original. [eos]
[sos] but you'll be asleep in about one minute. [eos]
[sos] i'm just yawning because the commercials are on. [eos]
[sos] okay. i'll tell you how the show ends. [eos]
[sos] zzz. [eos]
[sos] so? [eos]
[sos] you know what that means. [eos]
[sos] i forgot. [eos]
[sos] sunday means we go to church. [eos]
[sos] oh, yeah. [eos]
[sos] put on a coat and tie. [eos]
[sos] why? [eos]
[sos] to show respect to god and others. [eos]
[sos] i'm glad sunday is only once a week. [eos]
[sos] i hope god didn't hear that. [eos]
[sos] he'll forgive me. [eos]
[sos] i'll do that in a minute. [eos]
[sos] the cat is meowing. he's hungry. [eos]
[sos] okay. i'll feed him right now. [eos]
[sos] you shouldn't make him wait. [eos]
[sos] i was doing my homework. [eos]
[sos] the cat doesn't care about your homework. [eos]
[sos] the cat doesn't care about anything. [eos]
[sos] that's the way cats are. [eos]
[sos] all they think about is themselves. [eos]
[sos] maybe we should get rid of him. [eos]
[sos] of course not! he's family. [eos]
[sos] me too. [eos]
[sos] i just cut myself again. [eos]
[sos] did you use a new blade? [eos]
[sos] it doesn't matter. old blades cut, new blades cut. [eos]
[sos] maybe you should use an electric shaver. [eos]
[sos] they make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave. [eos]
[sos] maybe you should stop shaving. [eos]
[sos] and grow a beard? [eos]
[sos] sure. why not? [eos]
[sos] because food and other stuff sticks in my beard. [eos]
[sos] hmm. here's an idea. put cream on your face and have the cat lick it off. [eos]
[sos] yes? [eos]
[sos] are you reading this paper? [eos]
[sos] oh, no. help yourself. [eos]
[sos] i asked because the paper is sitting next to you. [eos]
[sos] thank you. that's polite of you to ask. [eos]
[sos] some people would just pick it up. [eos]
[sos] yes, i know. some people are rude. [eos]
[sos] i always try to be polite. [eos]
[sos] so do i. [eos]
[sos] the world needs more polite people like us. [eos]
[sos] i agree 100 percent. [eos]
[sos] let me think about it. [eos]
[sos] why do you have to think about it? [eos]
[sos] because a puppy costs money. [eos]
[sos] no, it doesn't. puppies are free. [eos]
[sos] yes, but a puppy needs shots. [eos]
[sos] shots for what? [eos]
[sos] so it won't get sick. just like you get shots. [eos]
[sos] i hate shots. [eos]
[sos] and a puppy eats food. food costs money. [eos]
[sos] no problem. i'll give him food off my plate. [eos]
[sos] oh, no you don't. puppies don't eat vegetables. [eos]
[sos] how many are there? [eos]
[sos] eight. [eos]
[sos] they're all so cute. [eos]
[sos] yes, but i can't keep them. [eos]
[sos] what are you going to do with them? [eos]
[sos] i'm going to give them away. do you want one? [eos]
[sos] yes, i would love one. [eos]
[sos] which one do you want? [eos]
[sos] that one. the one that's all black. [eos]
[sos] yes, i like that one, too. [eos]
[sos] i'll call him blacky. [eos]
[sos] they trust in god. [eos]
[sos] they hope they will go to heaven. [eos]
[sos] they probably will. [eos]
[sos] but no one knows for sure. [eos]
[sos] that's for sure. [eos]
[sos] no one knows what happens after we die. [eos]
[sos] if we are good, we will be happy in heaven with god. [eos]
[sos] that's what many people believe. [eos]
[sos] if we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell. [eos]
[sos] i don't want to go to hell. [eos]
[sos] let's go to church with your parents on sunday. [eos]
[sos] i'm sorry for you. [eos]
[sos] thank you. [eos]
[sos] when did he die? [eos]
[sos] a couple of months ago. [eos]
[sos] you still miss him. [eos]
[sos] yes, but i talk to him almost every day. [eos]
[sos] when you go to church? [eos]
[sos] no, when i call him on his cell phone. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] i buried him with his cell phone. [eos]
[sos] what will you do when the battery dies? [eos]
[sos] that's a bad day. [eos]
[sos] it's supposed to be unlucky. [eos]
[sos] you're supposed to stay home all day. [eos]
[sos] that's what i do. [eos]
[sos] my friend stayed in a hotel on friday the thirteenth. [eos]
[sos] that was a mistake. [eos]
[sos] he stayed on the thirteenth floor. [eos]
[sos] what happened? [eos]
[sos] someone stole his laptop. [eos]
[sos] he was asking for it. [eos]
[sos] he learned his lesson. he's home today. [eos]
[sos] of course. [eos]
[sos] prove it. [eos]
[sos] how can i prove it? [eos]
[sos] take me to dinner. [eos]
[sos] that's it? that's all i have to do? [eos]
[sos] take me to a nice restaurant, not to mcdonald's. [eos]
[sos] but a nice restaurant costs money. [eos]
[sos] yes, and you have to make a reservation. [eos]
[sos] that's such a hassle. [eos]
[sos] i knew you didn't love me. [eos]
[sos] okay, okay! i'll make a reservation right now. [eos]
[sos] so are mine. [eos]
[sos] why did your parents get divorced? [eos]
[sos] my father found a new girlfriend. [eos]
[sos] that's too bad. [eos]
[sos] my mother was hurt and angry. [eos]
[sos] she had good reason. what did she do? [eos]
[sos] she told him to drop his girlfriend. [eos]
[sos] what did your father do? [eos]
[sos] he moved out of our house. [eos]
[sos] i guess he really liked his new girlfriend. [eos]
[sos] yes, but she left him a year later. [eos]
[sos] so does mine. [eos]
[sos] i think it's an old people's smell. [eos]
[sos] really? [eos]
[sos] yes. i think when you get old, you begin to smell. [eos]
[sos] like fruit that is too ripe? [eos]
[sos] yes, just like fruit that is too ripe. [eos]
[sos] but the smell is different. [eos]
[sos] yes, old people don't smell like fruit. [eos]
[sos] no, they smell like a thrift shop. [eos]
[sos] yes, a thrift shop has that same smell. [eos]
[sos] yes, an old smell. [eos]
[sos] i think stamps used to cost a penny. [eos]
[sos] that was a long time ago. [eos]
[sos] it was before i was born. [eos]
[sos] now a stamp is 42 cents. [eos]
[sos] but in may it will be 44 cents. [eos]
[sos] have you ever lost a letter in the mail? [eos]
[sos] no, i haven't. [eos]
[sos] neither have i. [eos]
[sos] so, they do a good job for the money. [eos]
[sos] yes, they do. [eos]
[sos] maybe we shouldn't complain. [eos]
[sos] what are you going to do? [eos]
[sos] first, i have to find the button. [eos]
[sos] where did you lose it? [eos]
[sos] i have no idea. [eos]
[sos] a button is hard to find. did you look in your pant cuffs? [eos]
[sos] that's a good idea. [eos]
[sos] i found a button in my pant cuffs one time. [eos]
[sos] let me look. no, it's not there. [eos]
[sos] many shirts come with an extra button. [eos]
[sos] you're right. this one does have an extra button. [eos]
[sos] now all you have to do is sew it on. [eos]
[sos] you drink too much coffee. [eos]
[sos] but i love coffee. [eos]
[sos] well, it's your life. [eos]
[sos] you eat too much chocolate. [eos]
[sos] i don't think so. [eos]
[sos] have you looked in the mirror? [eos]
[sos] do you think i'm getting fat? [eos]
[sos] i didn't say that. [eos]
[sos] what did you say? [eos]
[sos] i said i have to go to the bathroom. [eos]
[sos] that's what i thought you said. [eos]
[sos] yes, i did. [eos]
[sos] what did you wash? [eos]
[sos] i washed the sheets and towels. [eos]
[sos] what about the pillowcases? [eos]
[sos] yes, i took them off the pillows and washed them. [eos]
[sos] did you dry everything in the dryer? [eos]
[sos] yes, i dried everything in the dryer. [eos]
[sos] then what did you do? [eos]
[sos] i folded all the towels. [eos]
[sos] did you put the sheets on the beds? [eos]
[sos] yes, and i put the pillowcases on the pillows. [eos]
[sos] i listen day and night. [eos]
[sos] what do you listen to? [eos]
[sos] mostly talk radio. [eos]
[sos] what's that? [eos]
[sos] people talk about current events. [eos]
[sos] what do they say? [eos]
[sos] they say they want change. [eos]
[sos] what kind of change? [eos]
[sos] they want tax cuts. [eos]
[sos] why do they want tax cuts? [eos]
[sos] because tax cuts will save them money. [eos]
[sos] look in the fridge. [eos]
[sos] i'm looking. there's nothing to eat. [eos]
[sos] are you sure? [eos]
[sos] it's almost empty. [eos]
[sos] i went to the market yesterday. [eos]
[sos] i don't see anything. [eos]
[sos] i bought lots of oranges and apples. [eos]
[sos] i don't want fruit. i want something tasty. [eos]
[sos] eat the fruit. it's good for you. [eos]
[sos] next time you go to the market, let me go with you. [eos]
[sos] no, thank you. all you want to eat are hot dogs and candy bars. [eos]
[sos] i don't know. look in the fridge. [eos]
[sos] i think i'll make a sandwich. [eos]
[sos] what kind? [eos]
[sos] a ham sandwich. [eos]
[sos] the bread is in the cabinet. [eos]
[sos] where's the mustard? [eos]
[sos] it's in the fridge, i think. [eos]
[sos] oh, yes, here it is. do you want a sandwich? [eos]
[sos] yes, that sounds nice. [eos]
[sos] how about some potato chips? [eos]
[sos] yes. and a pickle, if we have any. [eos]
[sos] but, mom, i'm not dirty. [eos]
[sos] you need a bath every day. [eos]
[sos] why? [eos]
[sos] because you don't want to smell bad. [eos]
[sos] i don't smell bad. [eos]
[sos] that's what you think. [eos]
[sos] if i smelled bad, i could smell me. [eos]
[sos] i can smell you. [eos]
[sos] i can smell you, too. [eos]
[sos] that's my perfume. [eos]
[sos] when can i wear perfume? [eos]
[sos] exactly what? [eos]
[sos] all i get is a black screen. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter? [eos]
[sos] i think i know, because this happened before. [eos]
[sos] what happened before? [eos]
[sos] my hard drive crashed. [eos]
[sos] oh, no. that's bad news. [eos]
[sos] it sure is, but i'm going to call hp first, just to make sure. [eos]
[sos] will you lose all your files? [eos]
[sos] no, i always back up my files. [eos]
[sos] you're smart. [eos]
[sos] what did they say? [eos]
[sos] they said i need a new hard drive. [eos]
[sos] that's too bad. how much is a new one? [eos]
[sos] it's not too much, only about $85. [eos]
[sos] plus installation? [eos]
[sos] no, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace. [eos]
[sos] really? [eos]
[sos] yes, it's just a couple of screws. [eos]
[sos] that's nice. [eos]
[sos] it's a lot better than paying someone $60. [eos]
[sos] if my hard drive crashes, i'll just call you. [eos]
[sos] it's bluedog123. [eos]
[sos] bluedog123. are you sure that's all? [eos]
[sos] yes. [eos]
[sos] no. that's incomplete. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] what's your mailing address? [eos]
[sos] 456 cherry drive, pasadena, ca 91170. [eos]
[sos] that's correct. [eos]
[sos] so what's the problem? [eos]
[sos] bluedog123 is just the street. you have to give me the city, state, and zip code. [eos]
[sos] oh, i get it. my email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com. [eos]
[sos] you should unplug the phone. [eos]
[sos] that's a good idea. [eos]
[sos] do you want me to wake you in an hour? [eos]
[sos] no, thanks. just let me sleep until i wake up. [eos]
[sos] i'll start dinner at 6:00. [eos]
[sos] okay. i think i'll be awake by then. [eos]
[sos] if not, your nose will wake you up. [eos]
[sos] you mean i will smell the food cooking? [eos]
[sos] you might even dream about dinner. [eos]
[sos] i don't think i'm going to dream about anything. i'm really tired. [eos]
[sos] have a nice nap. [eos]
[sos] yes, dad, it was. [eos]
[sos] the son gave a nice speech about his father. [eos]
[sos] it was long, too. [eos]
[sos] i think it was about 45 minutes long. [eos]
[sos] but it went by fast. it was interesting. [eos]
[sos] i liked it. [eos]
[sos] i'll give you a speech like that, too. [eos]
[sos] do you think anyone will come to my funeral? [eos]
[sos] of course. [eos]
[sos] i think only the family will be there. [eos]
[sos] you have lots of friends. they will be there, too! [eos]
[sos] i had to blow my nose. [eos]
[sos] did you have to blow right next to the phone? [eos]
[sos] did you hear that? [eos]
[sos] of course i heard that. i thought a plane had crashed into your house. [eos]
[sos] it wasn't that loud. [eos]
[sos] i will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see. [eos]
[sos] okay. i'll take your word for it. [eos]
[sos] i thought you had an elephant in your house. [eos]
[sos] you're funny. [eos]
[sos] what did you say? i think i've gone deaf. [eos]
[sos] i'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose. i'll be right back. [eos]
[sos] really? how many do you have? [eos]
[sos] i don't know, maybe one hundred. [eos]
[sos] that is a lot of friends. do you have a best friend? [eos]
[sos] of course. i have lots of best friends. [eos]
[sos] how many best friends do you have? [eos]
[sos] i think about twenty-five. [eos]
[sos] hmm. i have only one best friend. [eos]
[sos] i feel sorry for you. [eos]
[sos] i have only a few friends. [eos]
[sos] you must be lonely. i will share my friends with you. [eos]
[sos] that's very nice of you. [eos]
[sos] why would i do that? [eos]
[sos] because men like to cheat. [eos]
[sos] some men do, but not me. [eos]
[sos] i'm watching you. [eos]
[sos] i'm an open book. watch me all you want. [eos]
[sos] if i catch you, you'll be sorry. [eos]
[sos] you won't catch me, because i love you. i'm not a cheater. [eos]
[sos] i will poke your eyes out. [eos]
[sos] i don't want any other woman. [eos]
[sos] i will chop your toes off, one by one. [eos]
[sos] honey, please. you're the only woman for me, forever. i swear it. [eos]
[sos] me too. [eos]
[sos] why do you hate to go outside? [eos]
[sos] i meet too many jerks. [eos]
[sos] i agree. [eos]
[sos] this city is full of jerks. [eos]
[sos] rude people are everywhere. [eos]
[sos] but what can you do? [eos]
[sos] you can yell at them. [eos]
[sos] and they will yell back at you. [eos]
[sos] yelling doesn't do any good. [eos]
[sos] no. the best thing to do is just stay home. [eos]
[sos] are you having problems with it? [eos]
[sos] i don't understand some things. [eos]
[sos] let me help you. [eos]
[sos] what does "mi" mean? [eos]
[sos] "mi" stands for middle initial. [eos]
[sos] what does "mm/dd/yy" mean? [eos]
[sos] that means month/day/year. use numbers. [eos]
[sos] i don't understand. [eos]
[sos] for example, if your birth date is january 12, 1987, write 01/12/87. [eos]
[sos] oh. that's simple enough. [eos]
[sos] always print clearly, and fill in the bubbles completely. [eos]
[sos] what do you want to do? [eos]
[sos] i want to get a puppy for my son. [eos]
[sos] that will make him so happy. [eos]
[sos] i'll get him one of those little dogs. [eos]
[sos] one that won't grow up too big. [eos]
[sos] and eat too much. [eos]
[sos] do you know which one he would like? [eos]
[sos] oh, yes, i took him there yesterday. he showed me one that he really liked. [eos]
[sos] i bet you had to drag him away. [eos]
[sos] he wanted to take it home yesterday. [eos]
[sos] i wonder what he'll name it. [eos]
[sos] i don't know. i just woke up. [eos]
[sos] why don't you look outside? [eos]
[sos] okay. it looks like rain. [eos]
[sos] why do you say that? [eos]
[sos] the sky is gray. [eos]
[sos] is it raining right now? [eos]
[sos] no. [eos]
[sos] how do you know? [eos]
[sos] the street isn't wet. [eos]
[sos] i have to go shopping today. [eos]
[sos] you'd better take an umbrella. [eos]
[sos] it's not even noon yet. [eos]
[sos] that means it will get hotter. [eos]
[sos] i am dying from the heat. [eos]
[sos] turn on the air conditioner. [eos]
[sos] it doesn't work. [eos]
[sos] what happened? [eos]
[sos] i don't know. [eos]
[sos] did you call the repairman? [eos]
[sos] of course. [eos]
[sos] when is he coming? [eos]
[sos] he's busy. he said next week. [eos]
[sos] why is that? [eos]
[sos] because i love the snow. [eos]
[sos] yes, the snow is fun. [eos]
[sos] last year we made a big snowman. [eos]
[sos] how big was it? [eos]
[sos] it was seven feet tall. [eos]
[sos] how long did it take? [eos]
[sos] it took us all day. [eos]
[sos] did you give him a nose? [eos]
[sos] of course. we gave him a big carrot for a nose. [eos]
[sos] let me help you make one this year. [eos]
[sos] what do you need to do? [eos]
[sos] i need to withdraw some money. [eos]
[sos] how are you going to do that? [eos]
[sos] i'll just use the atm. [eos]
[sos] what's that? [eos]
[sos] it's the automatic teller machine. [eos]
[sos] it gives you money? [eos]
[sos] i just insert my debit card into the machine. [eos]
[sos] and it gives you money? [eos]
[sos] well, it gives me money, but it's my own money. [eos]
[sos] oh. what good is that? i thought it gave you free money. [eos]
[sos] oh, no. i forgot. [eos]
[sos] well, you'd better take it out front. [eos]
[sos] what time does the recycle truck come by? [eos]
[sos] it usually gets here at noon on tuesday, which is tomorrow. [eos]
[sos] i'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning. [eos]
[sos] oh, no, you don't. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] every morning you get up late and rush off to work late. [eos]
[sos] do you think i'll forget to do it? [eos]
[sos] you'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it. [eos]
[sos] okay, i'll take it out front right now. [eos]
[sos] ready for what? [eos]
[sos] ready for the big switch. [eos]
[sos] what are you talking about? [eos]
[sos] the nation is switching to digital tv. [eos]
[sos] oh. of course i'm ready. [eos]
[sos] did you buy the converter? [eos]
[sos] no, i don't need a converter because i bought a digital tv. [eos]
[sos] how much was that? [eos]
[sos] it was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen. [eos]
[sos] does it pick up any digital channels? [eos]
[sos] oh, yes. i get six korean channels but nothing in english! [eos]
[sos] they sure are. [eos]
[sos] did you hear about the pilot? [eos]
[sos] the one that stole a small plane? [eos]
[sos] yes, he stole a plane in canada and flew into the u.s. [eos]
[sos] did they catch him? [eos]
[sos] yes. after two u.s. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway. [eos]
[sos] did he crash? [eos]
[sos] no, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant. [eos]
[sos] did the cops find out why he flew into the u.s.? [eos]
[sos] his life sucked. he was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down. [eos]
[sos] poor guy. [eos]
[sos] how do you know? [eos]
[sos] the tv news is reporting a bank robbery. [eos]
[sos] do they know what the robber looks like? [eos]
[sos] yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old. [eos]
[sos] what race is he? [eos]
[sos] they didn't say. [eos]
[sos] the tv news doesn't tell us the race anymore. [eos]
[sos] of course not. that would be racist. [eos]
[sos] but how can we identify someone if we don't know their race? [eos]
[sos] don't ask me. [eos]
[sos] then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist. [eos]
[sos] but i don't have a tissue. [eos]
[sos] then go find a tissue in the bathroom. [eos]
[sos] i didn't have time to get one from there. [eos]
[sos] your sleeves are not tissues. [eos]
[sos] but mom, all my friends use their sleeves. [eos]
[sos] that doesn't make it right. [eos]
[sos] i saw dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday. [eos]
[sos] i will talk to your father about that. [eos]
[sos] i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age. [eos]
[sos] your daddy was a good little boy. [eos]
[sos] how do you know? were you his mommy, too? [eos]
[sos] worried about what? [eos]
[sos] i'm getting married. [eos]
[sos] you should be happy, not worried. [eos]
[sos] i am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility. [eos]
[sos] yes, you have to take care of your wife. [eos]
[sos] and i have to take care of our children. [eos]
[sos] are you going to start a family? [eos]
[sos] yes. we want to have a little boy and a little girl. [eos]
[sos] that sounds wonderful. [eos]
[sos] except we can't afford it! [eos]
[sos] no wonder you're worried. [eos]
[sos] or artists. [eos]
[sos] they're in a different world. [eos]
[sos] i saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils. [eos]
[sos] the artist said the jar was both full and empty. [eos]
[sos] but it was full of pencils! how could he say it was empty? [eos]
[sos] artists see things differently. [eos]
[sos] did you ever see anything that picasso painted? [eos]
[sos] of course! he's world famous. [eos]
[sos] did he ever take art lessons? [eos]
[sos] i can't believe it. i drew paintings like that in third grade. [eos]
[sos] where are they? maybe they are worth millions. [eos]
[sos] the point of what? [eos]
[sos] of living. [eos]
[sos] who knows? you live, and then you die. [eos]
[sos] we must be here for some reason. [eos]
[sos] maybe we're here to have fun. [eos]
[sos] then why aren't i having fun? [eos]
[sos] because you're thinking too much. [eos]
[sos] so i should stop thinking? [eos]
[sos] stop thinking about what the point is. [eos]
[sos] okay. i'll start thinking about having some fun. [eos]
[sos] just be patient. fun doesn't come along every five minutes. [eos]
[sos] so are cigarettes. [eos]
[sos] which would you prefer? [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] when you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes. [eos]
[sos] i could pick only one or the other? [eos]
[sos] yes. nothing's perfect, not even in heaven. [eos]
[sos] boy, that's a tough one. [eos]
[sos] what's so tough about it? of course, i would pick cigarettes. [eos]
[sos] but cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer. [eos]
[sos] well, you can't have everything. [eos]
[sos] i don't think i want to go to your heaven. [eos]
[sos] you shouldn't carry pens in your pocket. [eos]
[sos] yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe. [eos]
[sos] lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife. [eos]
[sos] who carries a sharp knife in their pocket? [eos]
[sos] criminals, of course. [eos]
[sos] anyway, i have to fix the hole. [eos]
[sos] you can sew it up or use an iron-on patch. [eos]
[sos] tell me about this patch. [eos]
[sos] the patch has glue. the hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on. [eos]
[sos] that sounds a lot easier than sewing. [eos]
[sos] it is. but after about ten washings, the glue washes off. [eos]
[sos] i can't remember jokes. [eos]
[sos] neither can i. [eos]
[sos] they go in one ear and out the other. [eos]
[sos] who makes up all these jokes? [eos]
[sos] who knows? but there must be a hundred new ones every day. [eos]
[sos] yes, just in english alone. [eos]
[sos] i wonder if every language has jokes. [eos]
[sos] of course! people everywhere like good jokes. [eos]
[sos] what do you think people joke about the most? [eos]
[sos] i think most jokes are about women. [eos]
[sos] oh, really? i think most jokes are about men! [eos]
[sos] why do you say that? [eos]
[sos] you speak two languages. [eos]
[sos] well, my english isn't perfect. [eos]
[sos] no one speaks perfect english. [eos]
[sos] maybe i will be the first! [eos]
[sos] i've been thinking about learning spanish. [eos]
[sos] spanish is easy. i'll be happy to teach you. [eos]
[sos] how long will it take me to learn? [eos]
[sos] i think it will only take you a year or two. [eos]
[sos] how soon can we begin? [eos]
[sos] ahora! that means right now. [eos]
[sos] yes, it's april 22. [eos]
[sos] it's more than just a date. [eos]
[sos] is it your birthday or anniversary? [eos]
[sos] no, it's earth day. [eos]
[sos] what's that? [eos]
[sos] it's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet. [eos]
[sos] oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff? [eos]
[sos] yes. we need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags. [eos]
[sos] how about if i take shorter showers? [eos]
[sos] that's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water. [eos]
[sos] from now on i'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower. [eos]
[sos] i don't know anyone who likes it. [eos]
[sos] some of it is okay, i guess. [eos]
[sos] yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember. [eos]
[sos] like "one, two, buckle my shoe." [eos]
[sos] but people still write poems. [eos]
[sos] no one makes any money at it. [eos]
[sos] shakespeare was a poet. [eos]
[sos] did he get rich from his poetry? [eos]
[sos] probably not. [eos]
[sos] poems are a little bit like songs. [eos]
[sos] yes, but songs have music. without music, songs would suck, too. [eos]
[sos] i don't know. i think i'm average. [eos]
[sos] did you ever take an iq test? [eos]
[sos] no, i never did. all i know is that i got a's and b's in school. [eos]
[sos] i wish i was really smart. [eos]
[sos] don't be ridiculous. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] if you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous. [eos]
[sos] don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart? [eos]
[sos] it must be very lonely. [eos]
[sos] why's that? [eos]
[sos] because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying. [eos]
[sos] nothing that would pass as news. [eos]
[sos] what's the weather going to be like this weekend? [eos]
[sos] i don't know. whenever the weather comes on, i switch channels. [eos]
[sos] what was the lead story on the news? [eos]
[sos] some actress was in court for driving without a license. [eos]
[sos] what was the second story? [eos]
[sos] some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter. [eos]
[sos] what was the third story? [eos]
[sos] a bull chased a man in a supermarket. [eos]
[sos] wasn't there anything about octo-mom? [eos]
[sos] of course. she's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants. [eos]
[sos] well, mostly i'll try to avoid it. [eos]
[sos] i mean, are you going to get buried or cremated? [eos]
[sos] my wife and i will be cremated. [eos]
[sos] are you going to be buried next to each other? [eos]
[sos] oh, no. our ashes will be shaken into the ocean. [eos]
[sos] you're not going to be buried? [eos]
[sos] a coffin costs too much and takes up too much space. [eos]
[sos] yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you. [eos]
[sos] children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery. [eos]
[sos] that's true. a cemetery is for dead people, not living people. [eos]
[sos] we figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach. [eos]
[sos] yes, of course i wiped my feet. [eos]
[sos] then why is there mud on the carpet? [eos]
[sos] i don't know. it's not my mud. [eos]
[sos] well, someone brought it into the house. [eos]
[sos] look at the bottom of my shoesthey're clean. [eos]
[sos] of course they're clean. you left all the mud on the carpet. [eos]
[sos] okay, i'll get the vacuum cleaner. [eos]
[sos] don't vacuum it now. [eos]
[sos] don't you want me to clean up the mud? [eos]
[sos] wait till it dries. it will be easier to vacuum. [eos]
[sos] next time i will be more careful. [eos]
[sos] what are you talking about? [eos]
[sos] sunday is mother's day. [eos]
[sos] this sunday? [eos]
[sos] of course. it's all over the news. [eos]
[sos] i thought it was next sunday. [eos]
[sos] well, you'd better get her something. [eos]
[sos] i'll get her a nice card. [eos]
[sos] is that it? [eos]
[sos] yes. that's all i ever give her. [eos]
[sos] she raised you, and all you ever give her is a card? [eos]
[sos] it's okay. she knows that i love her. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter with it? [eos]
[sos] it's too much like other flags. [eos]
[sos] yes, a lot of flags have stripes. [eos]
[sos] a flag should be pretty. [eos]
[sos] what should our flag look like? [eos]
[sos] it should have a pretty woman on it. [eos]
[sos] that's ridiculous! [eos]
[sos] you don't like pretty women? [eos]
[sos] of course i do. but not on our flag! [eos]
[sos] every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag. [eos]
[sos] you can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it! [eos]
[sos] what did you do? [eos]
[sos] i watered all the plants. [eos]
[sos] you have a lot of plants. [eos]
[sos] then i did my laundry. [eos]
[sos] that takes some time. [eos]
[sos] i took the dog for a walk. [eos]
[sos] i'll bet he enjoyed his walk. [eos]
[sos] i vacuumed the entire house. [eos]
[sos] that's a lot of work. [eos]
[sos] and then i made lunch. [eos]
[sos] i'll bet you were hungry! [eos]
[sos] so how do you make long distance calls? [eos]
[sos] i use a calling card. [eos]
[sos] where do you get that? [eos]
[sos] i buy it at the dollar store. [eos]
[sos] how much is it? [eos]
[sos] it's one dollar for 100 minutes. [eos]
[sos] that's only a penny a minute! [eos]
[sos] it's a great price. but you have to dial a lot of numbers. [eos]
[sos] how many? [eos]
[sos] first you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers. [eos]
[sos] yikes. i think i'll keep my long distance service. [eos]
[sos] yes, i do. [eos]
[sos] what college do you go to? [eos]
[sos] i go to pasadena city college. [eos]
[sos] do you like it? [eos]
[sos] oh, yes, i really like it. [eos]
[sos] why do you like it? [eos]
[sos] because it has great teachers. [eos]
[sos] what else? [eos]
[sos] i like all my classmates, too. [eos]
[sos] anything else? [eos]
[sos] yes. it's not expensive! [eos]
[sos] where did you lose it? [eos]
[sos] i don't know. [eos]
[sos] when did you lose it? [eos]
[sos] i think i lost it today. i used it yesterday. [eos]
[sos] did you check all your pockets? [eos]
[sos] i checked all my pockets. [eos]
[sos] did you look in your desk? [eos]
[sos] yes. it isn't there, either. [eos]
[sos] it's probably around somewhere. [eos]
[sos] oh, well, it only cost me a dollar. [eos]
[sos] only a dollar? don't even look for it. [eos]
[sos] what is gravity? [eos]
[sos] it's the force that pulls everything down. [eos]
[sos] i don't understand. [eos]
[sos] if you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass. [eos]
[sos] of course it does. [eos]
[sos] without gravity, the water would go up. [eos]
[sos] you're joking. [eos]
[sos] without gravity, you would go up. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] you would float into the sky like a balloon. [eos]
[sos] that would be fun! [eos]
[sos] turn on the light. [eos]
[sos] the light is on. [eos]
[sos] open the book. [eos]
[sos] the book is open. [eos]
[sos] see an eye doctor. [eos]
[sos] that's what i need to do. [eos]
[sos] he'll give you a prescription for glasses. [eos]
[sos] i'll make an appointment tomorrow. [eos]
[sos] i'll get the yellow pages for an eye doctor. [eos]
[sos] read the phone number to me. [eos]
[sos] i'll read it very loud, in case your hearing is getting bad, too. [eos]
[sos] i need pencils. [eos]
[sos] anything else? [eos]
[sos] i need a notebook. [eos]
[sos] do you need a pen? [eos]
[sos] no. i already have a pen. [eos]
[sos] do you need a calculator? [eos]
[sos] no. the teacher doesn't permit calculators. [eos]
[sos] how about a dictionary? [eos]
[sos] no, we have a big dictionary in the classroom. [eos]
[sos] well, i guess that's it. [eos]
[sos] yes, that's all i need for now. [eos]
[sos] so do i. [eos]
[sos] i read it once, and i subscribed. [eos]
[sos] it gives you all the news. [eos]
[sos] all the news in only 50 pages. [eos]
[sos] i like the political cartoons. [eos]
[sos] i like the beautiful photos of the houses for sale. [eos]
[sos] i always read the film reviews. [eos]
[sos] i never miss the food and drink section. [eos]
[sos] i gave a subscription to my parents. [eos]
[sos] me too. they canceled their other news magazines. [eos]
[sos] so did mine! [eos]
[sos] shake it a couple of times. [eos]
[sos] i shook it. there is no more ink. [eos]
[sos] you can borrow mine. [eos]
[sos] thank you. i'll buy a new one tomorrow. [eos]
[sos] what were you doing? [eos]
[sos] i was writing a letter. [eos]
[sos] who were you writing to? [eos]
[sos] it's to my mom. [eos]
[sos] tell her i said hello. [eos]
[sos] okay. i'll return your pen when i'm done. [eos]
[sos] take your time. [eos]
[sos] not yet. [eos]
[sos] then why are you watching tv? [eos]
[sos] this is my favorite show. [eos]
[sos] go do your homework. [eos]
[sos] but, mom! [eos]
[sos] you can watch tv after you do your homework. [eos]
[sos] but the show will be over. [eos]
[sos] there will be another show next week. [eos]
[sos] please? [eos]
[sos] you know the rules. [eos]
[sos] i hate the rules! i can't wait till i grow up. [eos]
[sos] me too. [eos]
[sos] no more homework. [eos]
[sos] i hate homework. [eos]
[sos] are you going to college? [eos]
[sos] i can't afford it. [eos]
[sos] me neither. [eos]
[sos] so what are you going to do? [eos]
[sos] i'm joining the army. [eos]
[sos] you're kidding. you might get killed. [eos]
[sos] i don't think so. after i finish, i'll have enough money to go to college. [eos]
[sos] that's not a bad idea. [eos]
[sos] english. [eos]
[sos] what are you going to do with an english major? [eos]
[sos] i'm going to be a teacher. [eos]
[sos] high school or middle school? [eos]
[sos] high school. [eos]
[sos] i teach high school english. [eos]
[sos] i didn't know that. [eos]
[sos] i started teaching five years ago. [eos]
[sos] how do you like it? [eos]
[sos] do you see all this gray hair? it was totally black five years ago. [eos]
[sos] maybe i'll teach middle school. [eos]
[sos] i'll say. [eos]
[sos] i drove around for half an hour. [eos]
[sos] did you find a spot? [eos]
[sos] i found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me. [eos]
[sos] did you yell at them? [eos]
[sos] yes, i did. [eos]
[sos] and? [eos]
[sos] and he yelled back at me. [eos]
[sos] how rude. [eos]
[sos] but i got lucky a few minutes later. [eos]
[sos] you have to be lucky to find a parking space. [eos]
[sos] yes, it has lots of rooms and lots of space. [eos]
[sos] and lots of books. [eos]
[sos] and lots of thieves. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] i mean, keep your belongings close to you. [eos]
[sos] the only thing in my backpack is used books. [eos]
[sos] but thieves don't know that. [eos]
[sos] they might think that i've got an ipod or laptop in there. [eos]
[sos] now you're thinking. [eos]
[sos] you'd think a library would be safe from thieves. [eos]
[sos] not even a church is safe from thieves. [eos]
[sos] i can add two and two. [eos]
[sos] so you're not very good at math? [eos]
[sos] i'm terrible at math. [eos]
[sos] well, i need some help. [eos]
[sos] with what? [eos]
[sos] i'm taking a math course in school. [eos]
[sos] well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help. [eos]
[sos] i can't do that. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] they might think i'm stupid. [eos]
[sos] they're not going to think that! they'll be glad to help you. [eos]
[sos] of course. [eos]
[sos] do you pray to god? [eos]
[sos] occasionally. [eos]
[sos] when's that? [eos]
[sos] when i need something. [eos]
[sos] like what? [eos]
[sos] well, if i have a big test at school. [eos]
[sos] does god answer your prayers? [eos]
[sos] yes, i've passed all my tests. [eos]
[sos] do you ever pray for money? [eos]
[sos] not yet. i won't need to do that until i graduate from high school. [eos]
[sos] what husband? [eos]
[sos] the husband of the driver who ran over two college students at 3 a.m. [eos]
[sos] oh, yeah. the girl died instantly, and the boy is still in the hospital. [eos]
[sos] the husband said he tried to help the boy. [eos]
[sos] yes, he pushed him off the hood of the car. [eos]
[sos] no, he said he gently placed the boy on the street. [eos]
[sos] so what? they still drove off. [eos]
[sos] the husband said a fire department was nearby. [eos]
[sos] so what? did he dial 911? [eos]
[sos] he said he was thinking about it, but he didn't get around to it. [eos]
[sos] he didn't get around to turning himself in, either. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] the seats and windows are dirty. [eos]
[sos] don't they clean the bus every night? [eos]
[sos] i think they do. [eos]
[sos] you should bring some wipes with you. [eos]
[sos] that's a good idea. [eos]
[sos] then you can wipe your seat and window. [eos]
[sos] people will think i'm strange. [eos]
[sos] who cares? everyone is strange. [eos]
[sos] that's for sure. [eos]
[sos] don't worry about what people think. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] number one, it's too slow. [eos]
[sos] you're right. a car is faster. [eos]
[sos] number two, it's usually late. [eos]
[sos] you're right. the buses are never on time. [eos]
[sos] number three, it doesn't run 24 hours. [eos]
[sos] you're right. buses don't run late at night. [eos]
[sos] number four, it's too crowded. [eos]
[sos] you're right. you have to stand in the aisle. [eos]
[sos] number five, it's unsafe. [eos]
[sos] you're right. bad guys might rob you. [eos]
[sos] what was the problem? [eos]
[sos] someone cut the tires. [eos]
[sos] what tires? [eos]
[sos] the tires on the cars. [eos]
[sos] where were the cars? [eos]
[sos] they were in the student parking lot. [eos]
[sos] how many tires were cut? [eos]
[sos] one or two tires were cut on each car. [eos]
[sos] how many cars? [eos]
[sos] eleven cars. [eos]
[sos] that's terrible. i hope they catch the person. [eos]
[sos] it sure isn't. [eos]
[sos] i got a ticket yesterday. [eos]
[sos] what for? [eos]
[sos] i was crossing the street. [eos]
[sos] were you in a crosswalk? [eos]
[sos] yes, but the red hand was blinking. [eos]
[sos] so? that's a ticket? [eos]
[sos] yes, it's a $140 ticket. [eos]
[sos] that's not right! [eos]
[sos] when i started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking. [eos]
[sos] you need to walk faster. [eos]
[sos] why do you say that? [eos]
[sos] the speed limit is 65. [eos]
[sos] i know that. [eos]
[sos] but you're doing 75. [eos]
[sos] so is everyone else. [eos]
[sos] but a cop might stop you. [eos]
[sos] no, he won't. some cars are doing 85. [eos]
[sos] so the cop will stop those cars? [eos]
[sos] of course. he stops the fastest cars. [eos]
[sos] my friend got a ticket for doing 75. [eos]
[sos] your friend was unlucky. [eos]
[sos] how often do i have to do that? [eos]
[sos] once every two months. [eos]
[sos] that's a lot. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] that's six times a year! [eos]
[sos] yes, and it takes about five minutes each time. [eos]
[sos] i'll try. [eos]
[sos] check your tires or you'll get a flat. [eos]
[sos] oh. that's not good. [eos]
[sos] no, it isn't. a flat costs you time and money. [eos]
[sos] and i don't have either. [eos]
[sos] i'm in a hurry. [eos]
[sos] don't ever be in a hurry. [eos]
[sos] it's not my fault. you didn't wake me up. [eos]
[sos] that's not my fault. you didn't tell me to wake you up. [eos]
[sos] well, i meant to. [eos]
[sos] don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] because you'll have an accident. most accidents are because people are in a hurry. [eos]
[sos] how do you know that? [eos]
[sos] i read a lot. [eos]
[sos] i thought drunks caused most accidents. [eos]
[sos] where are we going? [eos]
[sos] into the mountains. [eos]
[sos] that sounds nice. [eos]
[sos] i want to show you my new car. [eos]
[sos] you bought a new car? [eos]
[sos] yes. i bought a cadillac. [eos]
[sos] a luxury car. [eos]
[sos] luxury plus speed. [eos]
[sos] what are we waiting for? [eos]
[sos] let me get the keys. [eos]
[sos] let me get my camera. [eos]
[sos] why didn't you go before we left? [eos]
[sos] i did, but i have to go again. [eos]
[sos] well, hold on a little longer. [eos]
[sos] i think i'm going to explode. [eos]
[sos] just hold on. [eos]
[sos] oh! don't hit any more bumps! [eos]
[sos] we'll be at mcdonald's in just a few minutes. [eos]
[sos] i hope they are fast minutes. [eos]
[sos] think about something else. think about a hamburger. [eos]
[sos] i'm thinking, but i still have to go. [eos]
[sos] it's the next exit. hold on! [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] the car isn't here. [eos]
[sos] where did you park it? [eos]
[sos] i parked it right here. [eos]
[sos] are you sure? [eos]
[sos] yes. i remember this big tree. [eos]
[sos] maybe it's the wrong tree. [eos]
[sos] no, this is the tree. [eos]
[sos] did someone steal it? [eos]
[sos] i sure hope not. [eos]
[sos] maybe they towed it away. [eos]
[sos] i'd rather not. [eos]
[sos] it gets worse every year. [eos]
[sos] why are you complaining? we're going almost 20 miles an hour. [eos]
[sos] the speed limit is 65! [eos]
[sos] well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. [eos]
[sos] where are all these people going? [eos]
[sos] they're all asking the same question. [eos]
[sos] when are they going to fix this problem? [eos]
[sos] they said they need more money. [eos]
[sos] they always need more money. [eos]
[sos] it'll get worse before it gets better. [eos]
[sos] yes, he went through the red light. [eos]
[sos] can we call the police? [eos]
[sos] no, the police don't care. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] they have to see it happen. [eos]
[sos] they don't believe us? [eos]
[sos] no. they can only give a ticket if they see it happen. [eos]
[sos] so, what do we do? [eos]
[sos] we don't do anything. [eos]
[sos] maybe we should honk the horn next time. [eos]
[sos] the driver will just honk back at us. [eos]
[sos] why don't you wash it? [eos]
[sos] that's what i'm going to do. [eos]
[sos] are you going to wash it yourself? [eos]
[sos] of course. it's not a hard job. [eos]
[sos] i'll help you. [eos]
[sos] okay, i'll get a bucket. [eos]
[sos] i'll rinse the car first. [eos]
[sos] then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap. [eos]
[sos] after that, we can dry it with a towel. [eos]
[sos] then it will look like new [eos]
[sos] and you save $10. [eos]
[sos] paper is flying everywhere. [eos]
[sos] this wind is dangerous for drivers. [eos]
[sos] especially for drivers of big trucks. [eos]
[sos] the wind blows those trucks over. [eos]
[sos] it blows trees over, too. [eos]
[sos] a tree fell onto my dad's car. [eos]
[sos] was there much damage? [eos]
[sos] my dad had to buy a new car. [eos]
[sos] wow! that's terrible. [eos]
[sos] never park your car under a tree. [eos]
[sos] the wind will get you, or the birds will get you. [eos]
[sos] we'll stop at the next mcdonald's. [eos]
[sos] how far away is that? [eos]
[sos] i think we'll be there in half an hour. [eos]
[sos] i hope so. i have to go to the bathroom. [eos]
[sos] well, i can always pull over. [eos]
[sos] no, thank you, i'll just wait. [eos]
[sos] we can kill two birds with one stone. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] while you're using the bathroom, i'll order some food. [eos]
[sos] don't order for me. i'm not hungry. [eos]
[sos] i'm very hungry. i'll order for you, and then i'll eat yours. [eos]
[sos] look how many cars are waiting in line. [eos]
[sos] they need a left-turn arrow. [eos]
[sos] only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes. [eos]
[sos] we'll be here forever. [eos]
[sos] get out of this lane. [eos]
[sos] but we need to turn left. [eos]
[sos] forget it. go straight. [eos]
[sos] then what? [eos]
[sos] then we'll just make a u-turn. [eos]
[sos] and then we can turn right at the light. [eos]
[sos] good idea. it will be so much quicker. [eos]
[sos] how much money do you have? [eos]
[sos] $1,000. [eos]
[sos] well, that should get you something. [eos]
[sos] but i need something that's reliable. [eos]
[sos] you need a car with low mileage. [eos]
[sos] a car that was owned by a little old lady. [eos]
[sos] where have you looked? [eos]
[sos] i haven't looked anywhere yet. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] because i'll never find one for such a low price. [eos]
[sos] you're right about that. keep saving your money. [eos]
[sos] your driver's license and registration, please. [eos]
[sos] here you go. [eos]
[sos] do you know why i pulled you over? [eos]
[sos] i have no idea. all of a sudden i heard your siren. [eos]
[sos] you rolled through that stop sign back there. [eos]
[sos] but i stopped! [eos]
[sos] no, you didn't. you slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop. [eos]
[sos] well, nobody else does, so why should i? [eos]
[sos] that's not the attitude of a good driver. [eos]
[sos] but i am a good driver. i've never had a ticket in my life. [eos]
[sos] well, you've got one now. here. have a nice day. [eos]
[sos] what are you talking about? [eos]
[sos] i got a ticket downtown for $140. [eos]
[sos] were you speeding? [eos]
[sos] no, i was crossing the street. [eos]
[sos] were you jaywalking? [eos]
[sos] no, i was in the crosswalk. [eos]
[sos] so why did you get a ticket? [eos]
[sos] the officer said the red hand was blinking. [eos]
[sos] was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk? [eos]
[sos] no, the white walk sign was blinking. [eos]
[sos] you should fight that ticket. i'll be your witness. [eos]
[sos] who? [eos]
[sos] two students from usc. [eos]
[sos] what happened? [eos]
[sos] a speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl. [eos]
[sos] what happened to the other student? [eos]
[sos] he landed on the hood of the car. [eos]
[sos] did he get off the hood? [eos]
[sos] no, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood. [eos]
[sos] i'll bet the car continued on its way. [eos]
[sos] of course it did. why stop after you've run over two people? [eos]
[sos] i hope they find them and put them in jail for life. [eos]
[sos] i got a dent in the parking lot. [eos]
[sos] how did you get it? [eos]
[sos] i don't know. maybe it was from a shopping cart. [eos]
[sos] those shopping carts are dangerous. [eos]
[sos] especially the metal ones. [eos]
[sos] i don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts. [eos]
[sos] that's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store. [eos]
[sos] did you save any money on the sale? [eos]
[sos] yes, i did. i saved about $50. [eos]
[sos] that's great. [eos]
[sos] yes, except this dent will cost about $150. [eos]
[sos] yes. it is a great movie. [eos]
[sos] i saw it twelve times. [eos]
[sos] i saw it eight times. [eos]
[sos] i have the dvd. [eos]
[sos] so do i. [eos]
[sos] let's go to your home. [eos]
[sos] we can watch my dvd. [eos]
[sos] and then we can go to my home. [eos]
[sos] and watch your dvd. [eos]
[sos] i always cry at the end. [eos]
[sos] me too. it's so sad. [eos]
[sos] i don't know any card games. [eos]
[sos] i'll teach you one. [eos]
[sos] okay. what will you teach me? [eos]
[sos] it's called poker. [eos]
[sos] is it easy to learn? [eos]
[sos] yes, it will only take about 30 minutes. [eos]
[sos] okay. teach me how to play. [eos]
[sos] we each get five cards. [eos]
[sos] oh, look. i have four tens. [eos]
[sos] that's great, but you're not supposed to tell me. [eos]
[sos] oh. sorry. okay, i don't have four tens. [eos]
[sos] why is that? [eos]
[sos] because i watch the other players. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] people will tell you if they have a good hand. [eos]
[sos] how do they do that? [eos]
[sos] for example, a friend of mine licks his lips. [eos]
[sos] when he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand? [eos]
[sos] i know he has a good hand, so i don't bet. [eos]
[sos] he never wins your money? [eos]
[sos] nope, and it drives him crazy. [eos]
[sos] he knows you can't read his mind. maybe he thinks you're cheating. [eos]
[sos] but i'm listening to it. [eos]
[sos] well, listen to it more quietly. [eos]
[sos] i can't wait till i grow up. [eos]
[sos] what will you do? [eos]
[sos] i will play the radio as loud as i want. [eos]
[sos] that's okay with me. [eos]
[sos] i will have a radio in every room of my house. [eos]
[sos] remind me to never visit you. [eos]
[sos] all the radios will be on extra loud. [eos]
[sos] your neighbors will hate you. [eos]
[sos] if they don't like it, they can move. [eos]
[sos] your chances are very small. [eos]
[sos] but you can't win if you don't play. [eos]
[sos] ha! you can't win if you do play. [eos]
[sos] someone has to win. [eos]
[sos] that's what everyone says. [eos]
[sos] it might as well be me. [eos]
[sos] that's what everyone says. [eos]
[sos] you're trying to tell me something. [eos]
[sos] that didn't take long. [eos]
[sos] you think i should quit playing. [eos]
[sos] save your money for school. [eos]
[sos] nothing much. [eos]
[sos] what about the baseball game? [eos]
[sos] it got rained out. [eos]
[sos] rained out? [eos]
[sos] yes, rained out. [eos]
[sos] how could that be? [eos]
[sos] well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm. [eos]
[sos] i thought they were playing under a dome. [eos]
[sos] the dome doesn't close. [eos]
[sos] why doesn't it close? [eos]
[sos] who knows? they said they'll fix it before next season. [eos]
[sos] sure. here you go. [eos]
[sos] hmm, that's not bad. [eos]
[sos] there's nothing in it. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] i mean, it's just coffee. [eos]
[sos] i figured that. [eos]
[sos] it's not too bitter for you? [eos]
[sos] it's a little bitter, but it's okay. [eos]
[sos] there's no sugar or cream in it. [eos]
[sos] no, it's a taste you have to get used to. [eos]
[sos] sort of like beer. [eos]
[sos] what's the weather like? [eos]
[sos] let me step outside and see. [eos]
[sos] it's a little chilly, right? [eos]
[sos] yes, it is. [eos]
[sos] i'll put on my cap. [eos]
[sos] wear a jacket, too. [eos]
[sos] i wonder if i should bring my gloves. [eos]
[sos] maybe you should, just in case it gets colder. [eos]
[sos] i'll put a glove in each pocket. [eos]
[sos] we'll get warmer as we walk. [eos]
[sos] yes, but it gets colder as the sun goes down. [eos]
[sos] that driver is crazy. [eos]
[sos] i can't believe he hasn't crashed. [eos]
[sos] how fast is he going? [eos]
[sos] they say he's going 80 miles per hour. [eos]
[sos] he's going to kill someone. [eos]
[sos] look! he just hit that car. [eos]
[sos] oh, my goodness. no one is safe on the streets. [eos]
[sos] now he's slowing down. [eos]
[sos] maybe he ran out of gas. [eos]
[sos] look! he just got out of the car and started running. [eos]
[sos] i hope the police catch him. [eos]
[sos] they shouldn't even call it news. [eos]
[sos] last night they told us about a cat in a sofa. [eos]
[sos] yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe. [eos]
[sos] last week they told us about a bear in a back yard. [eos]
[sos] last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant. [eos]
[sos] the weatherman tells us the temperature in every town. [eos]
[sos] the sports guy shows us players fighting. [eos]
[sos] they always tell us "what's next." [eos]
[sos] they always make "what's next" sound exciting, but it never is. [eos]
[sos] it's more like news for kids. [eos]
[sos] they should have kid reporters. [eos]
[sos] computers are so cool. [eos]
[sos] i love to go online. [eos]
[sos] the internet is amazing. [eos]
[sos] you can travel all over the world. [eos]
[sos] i know. i went to china yesterday. [eos]
[sos] what did you do? [eos]
[sos] i stood on the great wall and looked all around. [eos]
[sos] what was it like? [eos]
[sos] it was like the real thing. [eos]
[sos] it was like being there? [eos]
[sos] yes, i felt like i was actually there. [eos]
[sos] they are the best musical group ever. [eos]
[sos] i love all their songs. [eos]
[sos] i don't know which one i like the best. [eos]
[sos] i like the ones i can sing along with. [eos]
[sos] so do i, like "she loves you." [eos]
[sos] "she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah!..." [eos]
[sos] "and you know you should be glad!" [eos]
[sos] what a great song. [eos]
[sos] how about "let it be?" [eos]
[sos] oh, yes! "let it be, let it be" [eos]
[sos] "there will be an answer, let it be!" [eos]
[sos] i'd rather not. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] you know i don't like crowds. [eos]
[sos] let's go to an early movie. [eos]
[sos] okay, that won't be very crowded. [eos]
[sos] what would you like to see? [eos]
[sos] oh, i don't care. you're the one who wants to go out. [eos]
[sos] well, i want to see "the pursuit of happyness." [eos]
[sos] what have you heard about it? [eos]
[sos] it's based on a true story about a divorced man and his young son. [eos]
[sos] well, i hope it has a happy ending. [eos]
[sos] i like to watch people. [eos]
[sos] that's your favorite thing to do? [eos]
[sos] well, it's one of them. [eos]
[sos] where do you go to watch people? [eos]
[sos] my girlfriend and i sit outside starbucks. [eos]
[sos] that sounds like a good spot. [eos]
[sos] we watch people walk by with their dogs. [eos]
[sos] i guess you see lots of different dogs. [eos]
[sos] we don't even know what kind most of them are. [eos]
[sos] there are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common. [eos]
[sos] yes, they love to sniff each other when they meet. [eos]
[sos] yes, he was on the tv news today. [eos]
[sos] every easter sunday he gives away money. [eos]
[sos] is it his money? [eos]
[sos] no. movie stars give him money to give to homeless people. [eos]
[sos] how much money does he give away? [eos]
[sos] this year he gave away $15,000. [eos]
[sos] that's a lot of money. [eos]
[sos] he gave $100 to people in wheelchairs. [eos]
[sos] what about the other homeless people? [eos]
[sos] they got $1 each. [eos]
[sos] people stood in line just to get one dollar?! [eos]
[sos] even though they're in black and white. [eos]
[sos] a good story is more important than color. [eos]
[sos] actors didn't curse back then. [eos]
[sos] and there was no violence. [eos]
[sos] people today don't like that. [eos]
[sos] no, today people like lots of action. [eos]
[sos] i like a good story. [eos]
[sos] i like to see actors who are like real people. [eos]
[sos] like real people with real problems. [eos]
[sos] they still make movies like that. [eos]
[sos] yes, but they never make much money. [eos]
[sos] yes, everybody gets the public broadcasting system. [eos]
[sos] it puts me to sleep. [eos]
[sos] tell me about it. [eos]
[sos] a gardening show follows a knitting show. [eos]
[sos] a cooking show follows a sewing show. [eos]
[sos] a travel show follows another travel show. [eos]
[sos] i'll say! i've gone around the world a dozen times already! [eos]
[sos] now they're adding old tv shows to the old movies. [eos]
[sos] i sure would like to see something interesting for a change. [eos]
[sos] if more people donate money, pbs could offer new shows. [eos]
[sos] who wants to donate? public tv should be free. [eos]
[sos] is that a tv show? [eos]
[sos] yes. it's on every afternoon. [eos]
[sos] what's so good about it? [eos]
[sos] they have interesting lawsuits. [eos]
[sos] such as? [eos]
[sos] yesterday, a woman complained about a cell phone she bought on ebay. [eos]
[sos] was something wrong with the phone? [eos]
[sos] it works only in canada. [eos]
[sos] did the seller know that? [eos]
[sos] yes, and he didn't tell the buyer. [eos]
[sos] i hope judge judy made the seller take the phone back. [eos]
[sos] yes, but she looks like a man. [eos]
[sos] what difference does it make? [eos]
[sos] female singers are supposed to be pretty. [eos]
[sos] singers are supposed to sound good. [eos]
[sos] they should look good, too. [eos]
[sos] there are lots of ugly men singers. [eos]
[sos] men singers don't have to look good. [eos]
[sos] then neither do women singers. [eos]
[sos] well, i would never buy her cd. [eos]
[sos] but you would buy her cd if she was pretty? [eos]
[sos] yes. i would buy all of her cds. [eos]
[sos] yes, that will occur next month. [eos]
[sos] most of them are already broadcasting in digital. [eos]
[sos] the digital signal is very clear. [eos]
[sos] oh, no, it isn't! [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] i can't get a single channel. [eos]
[sos] do you have a digital tv? [eos]
[sos] of course. but i don't have cable. [eos]
[sos] you don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna. [eos]
[sos] but i have rabbit ears. [eos]
[sos] rabbit ears aren't strong enough. buy a digital antenna. [eos]
[sos] oh, really? [eos]
[sos] are you interested? [eos]
[sos] maybe. what is she like? [eos]
[sos] she's got a great personality. [eos]
[sos] uh-oh. that means that she's fat and ugly. [eos]
[sos] she's cute. [eos]
[sos] okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat. [eos]
[sos] she weighs 98 pounds. [eos]
[sos] okay, she's not fat. so what's the problem with her? [eos]
[sos] who said there is a problem with her? [eos]
[sos] the problem is she has no problemsshe's too good for me! [eos]
[sos] thank you. [eos]
[sos] would you have dinner with me? [eos]
[sos] i would like to. [eos]
[sos] can i pick you up friday night? [eos]
[sos] what time? [eos]
[sos] eight o'clock. [eos]
[sos] that sounds great. [eos]
[sos] we'll go to a french restaurant. [eos]
[sos] i've never been to a french restaurant. [eos]
[sos] i think you'll love the food. [eos]
[sos] i'm not going to eat any snails! [eos]
[sos] thank you. so do you. [eos]
[sos] i wish my eyes were blue. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter with green eyes? [eos]
[sos] nothing, except my favorite color is blue. [eos]
[sos] maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes. [eos]
[sos] but what if i'm a fish in my next life? [eos]
[sos] i think some fish have blue eyes. [eos]
[sos] i hope i don't come back as a fish. [eos]
[sos] i hope i come back as a cat. [eos]
[sos] cats have beautiful eyes. [eos]
[sos] i would love to have blue cat-eyes. [eos]
[sos] i love you, too. [eos]
[sos] i loved you the first day i saw you. [eos]
[sos] it was love at first sight? [eos]
[sos] yes, it was love at first sight. [eos]
[sos] i didn't love you at first. [eos]
[sos] i know. i had to chase you for a while. [eos]
[sos] yes, you chased me and then you caught me. [eos]
[sos] now you're mine forever. [eos]
[sos] and you're mine forever. [eos]
[sos] we'll grow old together. [eos]
[sos] and be happy together. [eos]
[sos] have you told her? [eos]
[sos] of course not. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] she would laugh at me. [eos]
[sos] how do you know? [eos]
[sos] because they always do. [eos]
[sos] maybe she's different. [eos]
[sos] they're all the same. [eos]
[sos] just ask her out to dinner. [eos]
[sos] and then what? [eos]
[sos] and then she'll know that you like her. [eos]
[sos] i'm not in the mood. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter? [eos]
[sos] i saw you looking at that woman. [eos]
[sos] what woman? [eos]
[sos] you know, that woman with the big boobs. [eos]
[sos] i was not looking at her. [eos]
[sos] you were, too. [eos]
[sos] i'm not interested in her. [eos]
[sos] then why were you looking at her? [eos]
[sos] i was looking at something else. [eos]
[sos] oh, really? then spend tonight looking at the sofa. [eos]
[sos] you must be joking. [eos]
[sos] no, i'm serious. [eos]
[sos] i don't want to date a blind woman. [eos]
[sos] a blind date doesn't mean that she is blind! [eos]
[sos] what does it mean? [eos]
[sos] a blind date is a date with someone you don't know. [eos]
[sos] why would i date someone i don't even know? [eos]
[sos] to try something new and exciting. [eos]
[sos] what if i don't like her? [eos]
[sos] then you don't date her again. [eos]
[sos] really? who with? [eos]
[sos] a girl i met at the market. [eos]
[sos] you met a girl at the supermarket? [eos]
[sos] she was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter. [eos]
[sos] what did you say to her? [eos]
[sos] i had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where i had found them. [eos]
[sos] she asked you about your pineapples? [eos]
[sos] i told her i had gotten the last two on the shelf, but i offered her one of mine. [eos]
[sos] that was nice of you. [eos]
[sos] she asked me how she could return the favor, so i asked her out. [eos]
[sos] sometimes a slow line can be a good thing. [eos]
[sos] yes, in fact, i did. [eos]
[sos] who did you go out with? [eos]
[sos] a man i met in a coffee shop. [eos]
[sos] where did you go? [eos]
[sos] we went to a nice restaurant. [eos]
[sos] anywhere else? [eos]
[sos] then we went to a jazz club. [eos]
[sos] that sounds like a nice date. [eos]
[sos] yes, it was pleasant. [eos]
[sos] but you won't date him again? [eos]
[sos] no. he was nice, but there was no chemistry. [eos]
[sos] what happened? [eos]
[sos] first of all, he was half an hour late. [eos]
[sos] that's not a good start. [eos]
[sos] then he didn't bother to apologize. [eos]
[sos] that's rude. [eos]
[sos] then he drove too fast to the restaurant. [eos]
[sos] that's dangerous. [eos]
[sos] i thought about getting out and taking a taxi home. [eos]
[sos] what happened at the restaurant? [eos]
[sos] we had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip! [eos]
[sos] i guess you can't go back to that restaurant. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] he's a dirty old man. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] he's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out. [eos]
[sos] well, you can't blame a man for asking. [eos]
[sos] he should act his age. [eos]
[sos] but a lot of old people are still interested in dating. [eos]
[sos] they should find a nice hobby. [eos]
[sos] just wait until you're 50 years old. [eos]
[sos] dating will be the furthest thing from my mind. [eos]
[sos] that's what you say now. wait till you're 50. [eos]
[sos] sometimes. [eos]
[sos] what does she do? [eos]
[sos] just yesterday, i told her i wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world. [eos]
[sos] that was a nice thing to say. [eos]
[sos] that's what i thought. [eos]
[sos] what did she say? [eos]
[sos] she laughed! she didn't believe me. [eos]
[sos] that wasn't very nice of her. [eos]
[sos] she said that nothing is more important to me than money. [eos]
[sos] what did you say? [eos]
[sos] i told her i wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world. [eos]
[sos] i wish i had a good nose. mine is way too big. [eos]
[sos] i don't mean good-looking. i mean good-smelling. [eos]
[sos] oh. but that can be a curse. [eos]
[sos] yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors. [eos]
[sos] i'll say. my girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog. [eos]
[sos] did she catch you using drugs? [eos]
[sos] sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette. [eos]
[sos] you don't need a good nose for thatcigarettes stink. [eos]
[sos] but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening! [eos]
[sos] boy, that is a good nose. [eos]
[sos] i told her she should apply for a job at customs. [eos]
[sos] that sounds like fun. [eos]
[sos] where do you want to go? [eos]
[sos] let me think a minute. [eos]
[sos] i feel like chinese. [eos]
[sos] that sounds delicious. [eos]
[sos] i know a good chinese restaurant. [eos]
[sos] how far away is it? [eos]
[sos] it's only 10 minutes from here. [eos]
[sos] do we need reservations? [eos]
[sos] oh, no. we can walk right in. [eos]
[sos] let's go now. i'm hungry! [eos]
[sos] this is a popular restaurant, isn't it? [eos]
[sos] yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it? [eos]
[sos] it's the slowest hamburger in town. [eos]
[sos] that's because they cook it while you wait. [eos]
[sos] yes. that's why it's also the best hamburger in town. [eos]
[sos] a great burger and great service. [eos]
[sos] yes, the workers are very polite. [eos]
[sos] and they're clean. [eos]
[sos] i've been coming here for years. [eos]
[sos] me too. [eos]
[sos] excuse me. they just called my number. [eos]
[sos] thank you. [eos]
[sos] what kind of soup was that? [eos]
[sos] it was tomato soup. [eos]
[sos] that tasted so good. [eos]
[sos] i put lemon and butter in it. [eos]
[sos] the sandwich was good, too. [eos]
[sos] everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches. [eos]
[sos] especially on toast. [eos]
[sos] and the pickles were great, too. [eos]
[sos] tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch. [eos]
[sos] i can't wait. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter? [eos]
[sos] this steak has too much fat. [eos]
[sos] what do you want the waiter to do? [eos]
[sos] bring me a better steak. [eos]
[sos] i wouldn't do that. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] they will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it. [eos]
[sos] you're crazy. [eos]
[sos] then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak. [eos]
[sos] where do you get these crazy ideas? [eos]
[sos] i used to cook in a restaurant! [eos]
[sos] but we just got here. [eos]
[sos] did you see the waiter's hands? [eos]
[sos] no. [eos]
[sos] he had dirty fingernails. [eos]
[sos] really? [eos]
[sos] his nails were black! [eos]
[sos] that's disgusting. [eos]
[sos] and he poured water into our glasses. [eos]
[sos] yuck! no water for me. [eos]
[sos] i wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too. [eos]
[sos] who cares? let's get out of here. [eos]
[sos] i like this restaurant because they give you free bread. [eos]
[sos] well, i think we are paying for it. [eos]
[sos] no. look at the bill when we get it. there's no charge for the bread. [eos]
[sos] it is delicious, especially with butter. [eos]
[sos] i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread. [eos]
[sos] they probably wouldn't like that. [eos]
[sos] i'm eating so much bread that i'm getting full. [eos]
[sos] then stop eating the bread! [eos]
[sos] okay, just one more piece. pass the butter, please. [eos]
[sos] if i owned a restaurant, i would never serve hot bread before the main course. [eos]
[sos] that's terrible. i would never go to your restaurant. [eos]
[sos] well, the tables and chairs look okay. [eos]
[sos] okay, let's sit down. [eos]
[sos] check out the silverware. [eos]
[sos] it passes inspection. [eos]
[sos] here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean. [eos]
[sos] well, the waiter looked clean, so i guess it's okay to eat here. [eos]
[sos] you're forgetting about the bathroom. [eos]
[sos] i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean. [eos]
[sos] you're not going to examine it before we order dinner? [eos]
[sos] no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because i'm pretty hungry right now. [eos]
[sos] me, too. let's forget about germs and focus on food. [eos]
[sos] here he comes now. [eos]
[sos] we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes. [eos]
[sos] oops, i guess i was wrong. that isn't our waiter. [eos]
[sos] we can give him five more minutes, and then leave. [eos]
[sos] i'll go up front and talk to the manager. [eos]
[sos] that's a good idea. [eos]
[sos] maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long. [eos]
[sos] maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately. [eos]
[sos] every time we eat out, it's an adventure. [eos]
[sos] last time, we got seats next to the kitchen. [eos]
[sos] we'll never go there again. [eos]
[sos] no, it's too close to the kitchen door. [eos]
[sos] how about this table? [eos]
[sos] no, it's too close to the front door. [eos]
[sos] this looks like a nice table. [eos]
[sos] no, it's too close to the salad bar. [eos]
[sos] okay, i give up. [eos]
[sos] well, there is one good table. [eos]
[sos] great. which one? [eos]
[sos] that one. a group of eight just sat down at it. [eos]
[sos] what is it this time? [eos]
[sos] an andy warhol drawing. [eos]
[sos] he's a famous artist. [eos]
[sos] he drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant. [eos]
[sos] did he sign it? [eos]
[sos] yes. [eos]
[sos] is it beautiful? [eos]
[sos] it's just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains! [eos]
[sos] so it's not worth much? [eos]
[sos] only about $30,000. [eos]
[sos] without the food stains, it would probably be worth more. [eos]
[sos] of course. [eos]
[sos] i love baseball. [eos]
[sos] so do i. [eos]
[sos] i love to eat the peanuts. [eos]
[sos] i love to eat the hot dogs. [eos]
[sos] i hope we'll see a home run. [eos]
[sos] i hope we'll catch a foul ball. [eos]
[sos] bring a jacket. [eos]
[sos] yes. it gets a little cool at night. [eos]
[sos] bring a glove to catch a foul ball. [eos]
[sos] no. i'll just use my cap to catch a foul ball. [eos]
[sos] it certainly is. [eos]
[sos] you hit a white ball. [eos]
[sos] and then you chase it. [eos]
[sos] and then you hit it again. [eos]
[sos] finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground. [eos]
[sos] you do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes. [eos]
[sos] what's the point? [eos]
[sos] how can it be fun? [eos]
[sos] they pay money to play this silly game! [eos]
[sos] i think golfers have a mental problem. [eos]
[sos] i think they're nuts. [eos]
[sos] yes. that's a good idea. [eos]
[sos] where do you want to go? [eos]
[sos] we can go to the river. [eos]
[sos] or we can go to the lake. [eos]
[sos] or we can go to the ocean. [eos]
[sos] let's go to the lake. [eos]
[sos] yes. the lake is only 10 miles away. [eos]
[sos] we can be there in 20 minutes. [eos]
[sos] i'll get our fishing rods. [eos]
[sos] i'll get the bait. [eos]
[sos] we'll have fresh fish for dinner! [eos]
[sos] i like to hit the ball. [eos]
[sos] i like to run around the bases. [eos]
[sos] i like to slide into the bases. [eos]
[sos] yeah. it's a lot of fun to slide. [eos]
[sos] i want to be a baseball player when i grow up. [eos]
[sos] me too. i want to play for the yankees. [eos]
[sos] not me. i want to play for the dodgers. [eos]
[sos] we have to practice every day. [eos]
[sos] i don't like practice. [eos]
[sos] me neither. it's boring. [eos]
[sos] but practice makes perfect. [eos]
[sos] that's a good idea. [eos]
[sos] i bought some new shoes. [eos]
[sos] are they comfortable? [eos]
[sos] they're very comfortable. [eos]
[sos] how much were they? [eos]
[sos] they were on sale for $80. [eos]
[sos] do they help you run faster? [eos]
[sos] no, but my feet don't hurt anymore. [eos]
[sos] then they're worth every penny. [eos]
[sos] you might want to buy a pair. [eos]
[sos] i'll wait until i wear this pair out. [eos]
[sos] you can say that again. [eos]
[sos] but i'm worried about tiger. [eos]
[sos] why is that? [eos]
[sos] because he likes to scuba dive. [eos]
[sos] what's wrong with that? [eos]
[sos] it can be dangerous. [eos]
[sos] you mean he could drown. [eos]
[sos] he shouldn't scuba dive until he retires. [eos]
[sos] but he dives to relax. [eos]
[sos] he might relax, but it makes me nervous. [eos]
[sos] if his wife doesn't mind, you shouldn't mind. [eos]
[sos] the one that tiger won? [eos]
[sos] how did he do it? [eos]
[sos] it was nothing for him. [eos]
[sos] he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke! [eos]
[sos] he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke. [eos]
[sos] i think he is from outer space. [eos]
[sos] no human could possibly play golf that well. [eos]
[sos] whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot. [eos]
[sos] no human can do that. [eos]
[sos] somebody should check his birth record. [eos]
[sos] i bet it says he was born on mars. [eos]
[sos] there are so many great players. [eos]
[sos] yes, but who is the greatest? [eos]
[sos] i'd have to say babe ruth. [eos]
[sos] most people would say that. [eos]
[sos] he changed the game. [eos]
[sos] yes, he made the home run popular. [eos]
[sos] everybody loved him, all over the nation. [eos]
[sos] he helped make the yankees the best team ever. [eos]
[sos] and ruth was a good person, too. [eos]
[sos] he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids. [eos]
[sos] there will never be another babe. [eos]
[sos] no, please tell me. [eos]
[sos] someone punched out someone. [eos]
[sos] that's not nice. [eos]
[sos] it's worse than that. [eos]
[sos] how so? [eos]
[sos] two guys got into an argument. [eos]
[sos] i'll bet they were drinking. [eos]
[sos] a third guy punched one of the two guys. [eos]
[sos] i'll bet he was drinking, too. [eos]
[sos] the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died. [eos]
[sos] that's terrible. can't people just have fun at a baseball game? [eos]
[sos] is there a game tonight? [eos]
[sos] yes, it starts at 7 p.m. [eos]
[sos] can we get tickets? [eos]
[sos] yes, but only the cheap tickets. [eos]
[sos] how much are they? [eos]
[sos] they're only $5 each. [eos]
[sos] that's a good price. [eos]
[sos] yes, it's cheaper than a hot dog or a beer. [eos]
[sos] where are the seats? [eos]
[sos] they're behind the outfield. [eos]
[sos] maybe we can catch a home run ball. [eos]
[sos] what's so hard about hitting a little white ball? [eos]
[sos] it's hard if you want to do it right. [eos]
[sos] you mean like tiger? [eos]
[sos] no, like a good amateur golfer. [eos]
[sos] what's so hard about golf? [eos]
[sos] there are so many things you have to do right. [eos]
[sos] like what? [eos]
[sos] like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through. [eos]
[sos] yikes! who can remember all that? [eos]
[sos] you need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young. [eos]
[sos] forget it. golf sounds more like work than fun. [eos]
[sos] the home run hitter on drugs? [eos]
[sos] he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem. [eos]
[sos] he said he wasn't using drugs. [eos]
[sos] he apologized to the fans. [eos]
[sos] the league suspended him for 50 games. [eos]
[sos] that will cost him some money. [eos]
[sos] yes, about $7 million. [eos]
[sos] that will teach him a good lesson. [eos]
[sos] he probably won't use drugs anymore. [eos]
[sos] but it won't stop other players from using drugs. [eos]
[sos] no. everyone always figures that they won't get caught. [eos]
[sos] because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong. [eos]
[sos] is that it? [eos]
[sos] also, there aren't enough police. [eos]
[sos] but there are a lot of police. [eos]
[sos] there's only one police officer per 100 criminals. [eos]
[sos] can't we hire more police? [eos]
[sos] no. it costs too much money. [eos]
[sos] doesn't crime cost more than police? [eos]
[sos] yes, it does. [eos]
[sos] so it would be cheaper to hire more police? [eos]
[sos] yes, it would. [eos]
[sos] yes, it is. [eos]
[sos] people are friendly. [eos]
[sos] yes, they are. [eos]
[sos] the streets and sidewalks are clean. [eos]
[sos] yes, they are. [eos]
[sos] there's a real nice park nearby. [eos]
[sos] yes, there is. [eos]
[sos] i feel safe here. [eos]
[sos] there is no crime here. [eos]
[sos] i wish i could move here. [eos]
[sos] maybe you can, if someone moves out. [eos]
[sos] what happened? [eos]
[sos] the man fell asleep. [eos]
[sos] was he smoking? [eos]
[sos] yes, he was smoking a cigarette. [eos]
[sos] did he die? [eos]
[sos] yes, he did. his cat died, too. [eos]
[sos] that's too bad. what about his smoke alarm? [eos]
[sos] the battery was dead. [eos]
[sos] a good battery would have saved his life. [eos]
[sos] he had cigarettes, but no battery. [eos]
[sos] it happens all the time. [eos]
[sos] he's been in jail three times already. [eos]
[sos] why did they ever let him out? [eos]
[sos] it's the law. they can't keep him in jail forever. [eos]
[sos] why not? everyone knows he's a firebug. he loves to start fires. [eos]
[sos] i don't know. sometimes the law doesn't make sense. [eos]
[sos] but his latest fire killed someone. [eos]
[sos] this time they have charged him with murder. [eos]
[sos] so maybe he'll go to jail forever? [eos]
[sos] i sure hope so. [eos]
[sos] someone should set him on fire. [eos]
[sos] that would teach him a good lesson. [eos]
[sos] why? [eos]
[sos] because it will protect you in case of an accident. [eos]
[sos] but it's uncomfortable. [eos]
[sos] it's the law. [eos]
[sos] it's so much trouble. [eos]
[sos] it's common sense. [eos]
[sos] it's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe. [eos]
[sos] hold your breath till we get there. [eos]
[sos] okay, my seatbelt is on. [eos]
[sos] i'm glad you don't complain very much. [eos]
[sos] i'm ready for an accident. [eos]
[sos] i'm going to change the light bulb. it burnt out. [eos]
[sos] what are you standing on? [eos]
[sos] a couple of dictionaries and some textbooks. [eos]
[sos] are you crazy? [eos]
[sos] what's the matter? [eos]
[sos] those books will slip and you'll fall. [eos]
[sos] it's only a couple of feet. [eos]
[sos] what if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes? [eos]
[sos] i never thought about that. [eos]
[sos] you'd be blind for the rest of your life! [eos]
[sos] i'll get the stepladder. [eos]
[sos] yes. i called for a clean-up. [eos]
[sos] a puddle of water is very dangerous. [eos]
[sos] it isn't easy to see. [eos]
[sos] but it's real easy to slip on. [eos]
[sos] especially on these slick floors. [eos]
[sos] someone who slips could hurt their back. [eos]
[sos] they could even crack their head open. [eos]
[sos] we should stand here till the clean-up person gets here. [eos]
[sos] we can leave if we put an orange cone here. [eos]
[sos] yes, but i don't know where the orange cones are. [eos]
[sos]  it doesn't matter. here he comes now with the mop. [eos]
[sos] we tell our students to leave the classroom. [eos]
[sos] can they take their belongings? [eos]
[sos] yes, if they do it quickly. [eos]
[sos] where do the students go? [eos]
[sos] they go out to the north parking lot. [eos]
[sos] what do the teachers do? [eos]
[sos] we take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll. [eos]
[sos] why do you do that? [eos]
[sos] we want to make sure all the students are out of the building. [eos]
[sos] if they are all outside, then what? [eos]
[sos] then we just wait outside for a fireman to tell us to go back in. [eos]
[sos] why? we're already late. [eos]
[sos] i have to check the stove. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter? [eos]
[sos] maybe i left the burner on. [eos]
[sos] no, you didn't. i checked the stove before we left. [eos]
[sos] are you sure? [eos]
[sos] of course i'm sure. [eos]
[sos] well, i have to go back upstairs anyway. [eos]
[sos] it's getting later every minute. [eos]
[sos] i think i left the water running. [eos]
[sos] no, you didn't. let's go! the only thing running is the clock! [eos]
[sos] what are they paying? [eos]
[sos] up to $200 for each gun, no questions asked. [eos]
[sos] why are they doing this? [eos]
[sos] they want to get guns off the street. [eos]
[sos] who would turn in a gun for $200? [eos]
[sos] that isn't a good deal? [eos]
[sos] a good gun costs $400 or more. [eos]
[sos] well, if you bring your receipt, maybe they'll give you $400. [eos]
[sos] i'll keep my receipt and my gun. [eos]
[sos] i didn't know you had a gun. [eos]
[sos] everyone in america should have a gun. [eos]
[sos] i sure am. [eos]
[sos] you should go to bed. [eos]
[sos] i will as soon as i finish this article. [eos]
[sos] what are you reading? [eos]
[sos] it's about crime in los angeles. [eos]
[sos] what does it say? [eos]
[sos] the mayor says the crime rate is going down. [eos]
[sos] then why does everyone lock their doors? [eos]
[sos] i guess they haven't read this article. [eos]
[sos] no one believes that the crime rate is going down. [eos]
[sos] maybe the mayor is just talking about his own neighborhood. [eos]
[sos] why is that? [eos]
[sos] because of all the earthquakes and fires. [eos]
[sos] but big earthquakes happen only once in a while. [eos]
[sos] once in a while is once too many. [eos]
[sos] but you're right. there are a lot of fires. [eos]
[sos] a recent fire destroyed 85 homes. [eos]
[sos] still, it's safer than florida. [eos]
[sos] florida doesn't have earthquakes or fires. [eos]
[sos] no, florida just has hurricanes every year from june to october. [eos]
[sos] but most of those hurricanes are harmless. [eos]
[sos] excuse me. hurricane andrew destroyed 30,000 homes! [eos]
[sos] did you like it? [eos]
[sos] i loved it. i want to live there. [eos]
[sos] what did you like? [eos]
[sos] the island is so green, and the water is so blue. [eos]
[sos] did you go swimming? [eos]
[sos] i went to the beach every day. [eos]
[sos] how was the weather? [eos]
[sos] it was hot and sunny every day. [eos]
[sos] what did you do at night? [eos]
[sos] at night i went out to eat. the food was delicious. [eos]
[sos] people who live in hawaii are lucky. [eos]
[sos] what do you like about it? [eos]
[sos] we get a free breakfast. [eos]
[sos] coffee and a roll? [eos]
[sos] no, a real breakfast. [eos]
[sos] bacon and eggs? [eos]
[sos] with toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice. [eos]
[sos] wow! that is nice. let's stay for two nights. [eos]
[sos] and the rooms are clean, too. [eos]
[sos] do they allow pets? [eos]
[sos] no pets, no smoking. [eos]
[sos] i like that. let's stay three nights. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter? this is a nice room. [eos]
[sos] maybe the room is nice, but not the bed. [eos]
[sos] what's wrong with the bed? [eos]
[sos] look at this sheet. [eos]
[sos] yes? [eos]
[sos] see those stains? [eos]
[sos] i sure do. [eos]
[sos] i'm not sleeping on that sheet. [eos]
[sos] well, just call the front desk. they'll give us new sheets. [eos]
[sos] i want sheets without stains on them. [eos]
[sos] from now on, let's bring our own sheets. [eos]
[sos] it leaves at 12:15. [eos]
[sos] when do you have to be at the airport? [eos]
[sos] i have to be there two hours early. [eos]
[sos] so we have to be at the airport at 10:15. [eos]
[sos] that means we have to leave the house at 9:15. [eos]
[sos] well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems. [eos]
[sos] so maybe we better leave at 8:15? [eos]
[sos] yes, it's better to get there too early than too late. [eos]
[sos] i agree. [eos]
[sos] you never know what might happen on these freeways. [eos]
[sos] there's at least one huge accident every day. [eos]
[sos] when are you going? [eos]
[sos] during the christmas holidays. [eos]
[sos] you'd better buy your ticket now. [eos]
[sos] you must be kidding. [eos]
[sos] no, i'm not. it's march. time is running out. seats are selling out right now. [eos]
[sos] i thought i would wait until october. [eos]
[sos] i'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during christmas. [eos]
[sos] you're right. [eos]
[sos] well, listen to me. you need to buy a ticket now. [eos]
[sos] but maybe prices will be cheaper in october. [eos]
[sos] cheaper prices won't do you any good if there are no seats. [eos]
[sos] so do i. [eos]
[sos] a long time ago, flying used to be okay. [eos]
[sos] now it's like riding a bus. [eos]
[sos] you're jammed in with people all around you. [eos]
[sos] half of them are coughing, and the other half are sneezing. [eos]
[sos] you don't have any elbow room or knee room. [eos]
[sos] people are always getting up to use the bathroom. [eos]
[sos] kids are crying or climbing over you. [eos]
[sos] it's a flying zoo! [eos]
[sos] i wish i could afford first class seats. [eos]
[sos] doesn't everybody? [eos]
[sos] good for him. [eos]
[sos] why would he do that? [eos]
[sos] did he set a new record? [eos]
[sos] yes, i think he did. [eos]
[sos] well, i guess that's why he did it. [eos]
[sos] what's the point? [eos]
[sos] now he has the world record! [eos]
[sos] but someone's going to break it, so what good is it? [eos]
[sos] well, he can enjoy it while it lasts. [eos]
[sos] i don't think he even got paid for it. [eos]
[sos] some people do it just to do it. [eos]
[sos] that sounds like fun. where do you want to go? [eos]
[sos] i want to cruise to hawaii. [eos]
[sos] that should be a nice trip. lots of fun, and lots of food. [eos]
[sos] i have no idea how much it will cost. [eos]
[sos] i think it depends on the season and on your cabin. [eos]
[sos] well, of course i want to go when the weather is nice. [eos]
[sos] yes, you don't want to travel in winter storms. [eos]
[sos] and i want to get a big cabin with a view. [eos]
[sos] are you going to travel alone? [eos]
[sos] no, my sister and i will travel together. [eos]
[sos] well, you should go online and try to find a good deal. [eos]
[sos] because of all the security? [eos]
[sos] no, because it hurts my ears. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much. [eos]
[sos] that's just the altitude change, i think. [eos]
[sos] whatever it is, it hurts. [eos]
[sos] can't you take medicine or something for it? [eos]
[sos] i've tried everything, but nothing works. [eos]
[sos] have you tried earplugs? [eos]
[sos] they don't work, either. [eos]
[sos] well, be glad you're not a pilot. [eos]
[sos] are you going to go anywhere? [eos]
[sos] i was thinking of driving to arizona. [eos]
[sos] to the grand canyon? [eos]
[sos] yes. i've never been there. [eos]
[sos] i was there when i was a kid. [eos]
[sos] how did you like it? [eos]
[sos] i loved it. i still remember how amazing it was. [eos]
[sos] i'm sure i'll like it, too. [eos]
[sos] you should try riding a mule on a trail to the bottom. [eos]
[sos] no way! i don't want to fall to my death. [eos]
[sos] don't worry. only one person has ever fallen off a mule. [eos]
[sos] the worst in the whole world. [eos]
[sos] the walls were so thin. [eos]
[sos] all day long we heard tvs or telephones. [eos]
[sos] all night long we heard people snoring. [eos]
[sos] housekeeping didn't give us fresh towels. [eos]
[sos] room service brought us a cold dinner. [eos]
[sos] our nonsmoking room stunk of cigarette smoke. [eos]
[sos] our room was right next to the elevator and the ice machine. [eos]
[sos] they added phony charges to our bill. [eos]
[sos] how did we end up in that terrible hotel? [eos]
[sos] the travel agent gave us a 50-percent discount! [eos]
[sos] it's not even 10 o'clock. [eos]
[sos] i'm falling asleep on the phone. [eos]
[sos] you got up real early. [eos]
[sos] i had to take my friend to the airport. [eos]
[sos] why didn't you take a nap when you got home? [eos]
[sos] i didn't get home until 30 minutes ago. [eos]
[sos] why is that? [eos]
[sos] there was a bomb threat at the airport. [eos]
[sos] only a threat? [eos]
[sos] yes, but i was stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb. [eos]
[sos] someday the bomb is going to be for real. [eos]
[sos] why did he do that? [eos]
[sos] he was invited, along with about 90 other veterans. [eos]
[sos] who invited them? [eos]
[sos] some private organization. [eos]
[sos] why did they invite him? [eos]
[sos] to thank him and all the other soldiers who served in world war ii. [eos]
[sos] that's very nice. [eos]
[sos] my dad got to see the beautiful new world war ii monument. [eos]
[sos] that trip must have cost a lot of money. [eos]
[sos] he said all the money came from private donations. [eos]
[sos] tell me about it, dad. [eos]
[sos] about 90 of us world war ii veterans got on the plane at 8 a.m. [eos]
[sos] how long was the flight? [eos]
[sos] it only took about two hours. [eos]
[sos] did you take pictures at the world war ii monument? [eos]
[sos] oh, yes. we all took lots of pictures. [eos]
[sos] then you flew back home that evening? [eos]
[sos] yes. when we landed, tv reporters and the army band were there. [eos]
[sos] that must have made you feel really special. [eos]
[sos] oh, it did. there were about 300 people there to honor us. [eos]
[sos] well, you all deserve it. you helped save our country. [eos]
[sos] i thought you had a job. [eos]
[sos] i did. [eos]
[sos] what happened? [eos]
[sos] i got laid off. [eos]
[sos] that's terrible! when did it happen? [eos]
[sos] i got laid off last week. [eos]
[sos] just you? [eos]
[sos] no, ten of my coworkers got laid off, too. [eos]
[sos] what are you going to do? [eos]
[sos] i'm looking in the newspaper for a job. [eos]
[sos] good luck! [eos]
[sos] what's to check? [eos]
[sos] are your nails clean? [eos]
[sos] yes, they are. [eos]
[sos] did you double-check your nose and teeth? [eos]
[sos] they are clean, too. [eos]
[sos] did you shine your shoes? [eos]
[sos] my shoes are shined. [eos]
[sos] do your socks match? [eos]
[sos] of course they match. [eos]
[sos] no, they don't. one is black and one is dark blue. [eos]
[sos] yikes! thank you. [eos]
[sos] it sure is. [eos]
[sos] i thought school was hard. [eos]
[sos] me, too. i couldn't wait to graduate. [eos]
[sos] but now work is hard, too. [eos]
[sos] i agree. work is just as hard as school. [eos]
[sos] sometimes i wish i was back in school. [eos]
[sos] me, too. school was fun. [eos]
[sos] and it was only 12 years. [eos]
[sos] it went by pretty fast. [eos]
[sos] but work goes on forever! [eos]
[sos] we have to work for 30 years! [eos]
[sos] so am i. [eos]
[sos] i had a long day. [eos]
[sos] so did i. [eos]
[sos] i didn't even have lunch. [eos]
[sos] neither did i. [eos]
[sos] i was busy the whole day. [eos]
[sos] so was i. [eos]
[sos] i had to bring work home with me. [eos]
[sos] i did too. [eos]
[sos] your day was just like mine. [eos]
[sos] of course it was. we work together! [eos]
[sos] what do you do? [eos]
[sos] i'm a babysitter. [eos]
[sos] is that a lot of work? [eos]
[sos] babies cry all the time. [eos]
[sos] you have to change their diapers. [eos]
[sos] i have to feed them. [eos]
[sos] are you looking for another job? [eos]
[sos] no, i'm looking for another family. [eos]
[sos] another family? [eos]
[sos] a family with only one baby. [eos]
[sos] that's a good idea. [eos]
[sos] what was your last job? [eos]
[sos] i was a painter. [eos]
[sos] what happened? [eos]
[sos] i got laid off because there was no work. [eos]
[sos] what else can you do? [eos]
[sos] i'm a handyman. [eos]
[sos] can you fix a dripping faucet in a kitchen sink? [eos]
[sos] of course. [eos]
[sos] then i have a job for you in my kitchen. [eos]
[sos] it will cost you only $20 plus parts. [eos]
[sos] okay. that sounds like a fair price. [eos]
[sos] i have no idea. i've been here for 20 years. [eos]
[sos] do you have any other skills? [eos]
[sos] well, i know how to flip hamburgers. [eos]
[sos] no one would hire you to flip hamburgers. [eos]
[sos] have you heard something that you're not telling me? [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] are there going to be layoffs at this place? [eos]
[sos] i certainly hope not! [eos]
[sos] if you got laid off, you'd be flipping hamburgers, too. [eos]
[sos] oh great, we could both work at burger king. [eos]
[sos] maybe we'd get laid off there, too. [eos]
[sos] yes, and they ask me what jobs are the best. [eos]
[sos] i tell my students to become a teacher. [eos]
[sos] teaching is a great job. [eos]
[sos] it's the best job i've ever had. [eos]
[sos] what makes it so good? [eos]
[sos] for me, it's the students. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] i mean i have wonderful students. [eos]
[sos] that must be nice. [eos]
[sos] teaching is the best part of my whole day. [eos]
[sos] you're a lucky man to have a job you love. [eos]
[sos] how long did it take? [eos]
[sos] four hours, without a break. [eos]
[sos] it's always nice to finish a job. [eos]
[sos] well, it's good and bad. [eos]
[sos] what's bad about it? [eos]
[sos] when you finish, all you do is start another job! [eos]
[sos] yes, that's right. it does get boring. [eos]
[sos] especially if it's the same work, over and over. [eos]
[sos] but that's what most people do. [eos]
[sos] yes, i guess most of us are stuck in a routine. [eos]
[sos] i wonder if there is any job that you don't repeat over and over. [eos]
[sos] what makes him so bad? [eos]
[sos] he's rude and he yells a lot. [eos]
[sos] that's hard to take. [eos]
[sos] i've never heard him say please or thank you. [eos]
[sos] he sounds like a real jerk. [eos]
[sos] no one at work likes him. [eos]
[sos] can't you report him to his supervisor? [eos]
[sos] of course not. if i do that, i'll lose my job. [eos]
[sos] yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers. [eos]
[sos] i can't quit, because i'm making a good salary. [eos]
[sos] you shouldn't choose money over happiness. [eos]
[sos] about what? [eos]
[sos] about finding a job for me. [eos]
[sos] you don't need a job. i make enough money for both of us. [eos]
[sos] that doesn't matter. i don't want to sit around. [eos]
[sos] okay, what kind of job do you want? [eos]
[sos] i'm not sure. [eos]
[sos] well, you should do something that you enjoy. [eos]
[sos] i enjoy selling. i was born to sell. [eos]
[sos] okay, what do you want to sell? [eos]
[sos] cigarette lighters. i'll make a fortune. [eos]
[sos] but you hate cigarettes and you hate smoking! [eos]
[sos] yes, i saw it on the tv news. [eos]
[sos] they need 300 new workers. [eos]
[sos] and 4,000 people showed up. [eos]
[sos] so many people are out of work. [eos]
[sos] i still have my job, thank goodness. [eos]
[sos] so do i, but i'm worried. [eos]
[sos] me too. there are no guarantees. [eos]
[sos] if you lose your job, you can move in with me. [eos]
[sos] oh, thank you. that's very nice of you. [eos]
[sos] you would do the same for me. [eos]
[sos] of course. what are friends for? [eos]
[sos] what did you do? [eos]
[sos] i bought some stock. [eos]
[sos] everybody buys stock. [eos]
[sos] i bought it on a hunch. [eos]
[sos] you didn't read about the company first? [eos]
[sos] i didn't have to. it's been in business for 60 years. [eos]
[sos] so what's the problem? [eos]
[sos] i used all my savings on this one company. [eos]
[sos] you put all your eggs into one basket. [eos]
[sos] if the company goes out of business, i'll have nothing. [eos]
[sos] oh, you'll have somethingyou'll have a lesson you'll never forget! [eos]
[sos] what happened to your plans? [eos]
[sos] i got a d in college chemistry. [eos]
[sos] well, a d is better than an f. [eos]
[sos] a tutor helped me get the d! [eos]
[sos] so, you didn't become a doctor. [eos]
[sos] and now i'm glad that i didn't. [eos]
[sos] why's that? [eos]
[sos] a hospital is the most dangerous place in the world. [eos]
[sos] oh, yes, because of all the killer germs. [eos]
[sos] if you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals. [eos]
[sos] yes, the smart doctors are those tv news doctorsno hospitals, no patients. [eos]
[sos] why? [eos]
[sos] because you get to meet a lot of people. [eos]
[sos] you sure do. [eos]
[sos] and you get a lot of exercise every day. [eos]
[sos] that's the truth. [eos]
[sos] and you get to play with a lot of dogs. [eos]
[sos] well, you're supposed to be working. [eos]
[sos] yes, but i will always pet the friendly dogs. [eos]
[sos] what about the unfriendly dogs? [eos]
[sos] i think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you. [eos]
[sos] dogs are like peoplenot all of them are friendly. [eos]
[sos] to the state or the city? [eos]
[sos] to the city, of course. [eos]
[sos] why do you want to move there? [eos]
[sos] because i want to make a lot of money. [eos]
[sos] there are a lot of poor people in new york. [eos]
[sos] there sure areat least a million. [eos]
[sos] so how do you plan to become rich? [eos]
[sos] i will knock on the doors of all the corporations. [eos]
[sos] that won't make you rich. nobody will talk to you. [eos]
[sos] i will keep knocking on doors. [eos]
[sos] all you will get is sore knuckles. [eos]
[sos] me too. [eos]
[sos] i usually eat a simple salad. [eos]
[sos] what do you put in it? [eos]
[sos] just lettuce, tomato, and celery. [eos]
[sos] that's it? [eos]
[sos] i add some pepper and salt. [eos]
[sos] i always put cheese in my salads. [eos]
[sos] yes, cheese is nice. [eos]
[sos] what kind of dressing do you use? [eos]
[sos] i pour lots of french dressing on top. [eos]
[sos] me too. french dressing is so delicious! who cares about calories? [eos]
[sos] me too. [eos]
[sos] where does cheese come from? [eos]
[sos] it comes from cows. [eos]
[sos] so we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too? [eos]
[sos] yes, we do. [eos]
[sos] what else do we get from cows? [eos]
[sos] we get hamburgers and steak. [eos]
[sos] oh, that's so delicious. [eos]
[sos] we also get leather. [eos]
[sos] we get a lot of things from cows, don't we? [eos]
[sos] yes. a cow is man's best friend. [eos]
[sos] how did you like it? [eos]
[sos] i loved it! [eos]
[sos] did you get free food? [eos]
[sos] i ate free cheese and meat every day. [eos]
[sos] that sounds like a great job. [eos]
[sos] whatever a customer ordered, i sliced off a little more for me. [eos]
[sos] did you get fat? [eos]
[sos] no, but i did put on a few pounds. [eos]
[sos] that sounds like a dream job. [eos]
[sos] it was, until one day my manager caught me. [eos]
[sos] no more free cheese for you, huh? [eos]
[sos] what are you eating now? [eos]
[sos] i switched from pasta to potatoes. [eos]
[sos] why did you do that? [eos]
[sos] pasta is processed food. potatoes are natural food. [eos]
[sos] natural food has more vitamins. [eos]
[sos] and it's just as easy to prepare. [eos]
[sos] how do you prepare the potatoes? [eos]
[sos] i wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes. [eos]
[sos] that's pretty simple. [eos]
[sos] then i add butter, salt, and pepper. [eos]
[sos] can i have all those cans of tomato sauce you bought for your pasta? [eos]
[sos] why was that? [eos]
[sos] i sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before i tasted it. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter with that? [eos]
[sos] her mom is a great cook. [eos]
[sos] so, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything. [eos]
[sos] it hurt her feelings. [eos]
[sos] oh. [eos]
[sos] i apologized to her, but i could tell she was still upset. [eos]
[sos] maybe you shouldn't eat there again. [eos]
[sos] i'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two. [eos]
[sos] it's your girlfriend's fault. she should have warned you. [eos]
[sos] you're kidding. [eos]
[sos] no, i'm serious. [eos]
[sos] doesn't that get old? [eos]
[sos] no, because i'm eating food that i like. [eos]
[sos] but the same thing day after day gets old. [eos]
[sos] well, i guess if it ever does get old, i'll change to something different. [eos]
[sos] do you eat fruits and vegetables every day? [eos]
[sos] no, i hate vegetables. [eos]
[sos] but you eat fruits. [eos]
[sos] i eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day. [eos]
[sos] well, there's nothing wrong with that. [eos]
[sos] what's wrong? [eos]
[sos] it's not orange! [eos]
[sos] your orange isn't orange? [eos]
[sos] no, it's dark pink! [eos]
[sos] are you sure? i never heard of such a thing. [eos]
[sos] i just peeled it, and i'm looking at it right now. [eos]
[sos] let me see. yes, you're right. your orange is pink. [eos]
[sos] who ever heard of such a thing? [eos]
[sos] oh, look. here's the little sticker that was on it. it's called a pink navel. [eos]
[sos] what is this world coming to? [eos]
[sos] who knows? maybe soon we'll have pink bananas. [eos]
[sos] me, too. i love them roasted and salted. [eos]
[sos] i love boiled peanuts. [eos]
[sos] boiled? i never heard of that. [eos]
[sos] just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft. [eos]
[sos] i'll have to try them sometime. [eos]
[sos] they're best when they're hot. [eos]
[sos] my brother is allergic to peanuts. [eos]
[sos] that's not good. [eos]
[sos] no, it isn't. he almost died when he was little. [eos]
[sos] i guess he has to be very careful about what he eats. [eos]
[sos] he has a very strict diet. [eos]
[sos] how much have you gained? [eos]
[sos] three pounds just this month. [eos]
[sos] do you know why? [eos]
[sos] i think it's the ice cream. [eos]
[sos] you started eating ice cream? [eos]
[sos] it was on sale. [eos]
[sos] how much did you buy? [eos]
[sos] i filled up my freezer with ice cream. [eos]
[sos] well, it won't last forever. [eos]
[sos] no, i figure i'll finish it all by next week. [eos]
[sos] then you can start losing weight, if there isn't another sale. [eos]
[sos] of course you are. you ate everything on the table. [eos]
[sos] i don't like to eat leftovers. [eos]
[sos] i'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat. [eos]
[sos] i like my food hot and fresh. [eos]
[sos] you like to see it disappear. [eos]
[sos] i don't like it reheated. [eos]
[sos] well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night. [eos]
[sos] i'm so full i'm going to burst. [eos]
[sos] you should loosen your belt. [eos]
[sos] i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants. [eos]
[sos] well, don't stand up, please. [eos]
[sos] i didn't do anything. [eos]
[sos] oh yes, you did. [eos]
[sos] what are you talking about? [eos]
[sos] you know what i'm talking about. [eos]
[sos] i don't have any idea. [eos]
[sos] you know what you did. [eos]
[sos] maybe i know, but how could you know? [eos]
[sos] because i was watching you. [eos]
[sos] okay, i'm sorry i did it. [eos]
[sos] don't drink milk out of the carton. use a glass! [eos]
[sos] i promise i'll never drink out of the carton again. [eos]
[sos] so do i. [eos]
[sos] how much is it? [eos]
[sos] i don't know. the tag is missing. [eos]
[sos] ask the clerk. [eos]
[sos] i will. [eos]
[sos] oh, look. here's another shirt just like it. [eos]
[sos] does it have a price tag? [eos]
[sos] yes, it does. it's only $20. [eos]
[sos] that's a great price. [eos]
[sos] i think i'll buy both of them. [eos]
[sos] you'd better try them on first. [eos]
[sos] thank you. [eos]
[sos] i hope they fit. [eos]
[sos] i hope you kept the receipt. [eos]
[sos] you think they won't fit? [eos]
[sos] i think i've put on some weight. [eos]
[sos] you think? [eos]
[sos] maybe a pound or two. [eos]
[sos] maybe four or five pounds? [eos]
[sos] my waist is bigger than it was. [eos]
[sos] no problem. these pants have an elastic waistband. [eos]
[sos] you are so smart! [eos]
[sos] let me look at our list. [eos]
[sos] i know that we need milk. [eos]
[sos] nonfat. [eos]
[sos] of course. what else? [eos]
[sos] we need cheese, bread, and ham. [eos]
[sos] what kind of cheese? [eos]
[sos] swiss. [eos]
[sos] of course, the cheese with holes in it. [eos]
[sos] i never used to buy swiss cheese. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] i didn't want to pay for the holes. [eos]
[sos] i thought you just bought a pair. [eos]
[sos] i did. [eos]
[sos] what's wrong with them so soon? [eos]
[sos] the pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it. [eos]
[sos] you shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket. [eos]
[sos] but that's what pockets are for. [eos]
[sos] you should carry them in a purse. [eos]
[sos] i'm a man, and men don't carry purses! [eos]
[sos] well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets. [eos]
[sos] i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets. [eos]
[sos] try a google search online. [eos]
[sos] you use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart. [eos]
[sos] that's a great idea. [eos]
[sos] yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers. [eos]
[sos] i'm going to take five wipes. [eos]
[sos] what do you need five of them for? [eos]
[sos] one to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter with the produce? [eos]
[sos] do you think the bananas fell from the sky? [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] i mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges. [eos]
[sos] well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills you're going to pay with. [eos]
[sos] yes, i did. [eos]
[sos] what did you buy? [eos]
[sos] well, i got a lot of good deals, as usual. [eos]
[sos] like what? [eos]
[sos] well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents. [eos]
[sos] that's a good deal. [eos]
[sos] and a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price. [eos]
[sos] another good deal. [eos]
[sos] but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents. [eos]
[sos] i don't know how that store makes money. [eos]
[sos] neither do i, but they're doing something right. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter with yours? [eos]
[sos] it's six years old. [eos]
[sos] that's pretty old. [eos]
[sos] it still works, but i'm going to give it to a charity. [eos]
[sos] are you going to buy a desktop or laptop? [eos]
[sos] oh, a laptop, of course. [eos]
[sos] a pc or a mac? [eos]
[sos] i haven't decided yet. [eos]
[sos] more and more people are using macs. [eos]
[sos] but 90 percent of the world uses pcs. [eos]
[sos] and that's not going to change anytime soon. [eos]
[sos] what happened? [eos]
[sos] i had a car problem, so i went online. [eos]
[sos] did you find a solution? [eos]
[sos] yes, i did. a site i went to said they would send me the solution. [eos]
[sos] so, what's the problem? [eos]
[sos] i sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution. [eos]
[sos] what are you going to do? [eos]
[sos] i sent them an email asking for my money back. [eos]
[sos] have you heard from them? [eos]
[sos] not yet. it's been a week. [eos]
[sos] well, i guess that's a $20 lesson for you. [eos]
[sos] which one? [eos]
[sos] any one. i need to sharpen this pencil. [eos]
[sos] i think there's one on the dining room table. [eos]
[sos] i already looked there. [eos]
[sos] did you look in the desk drawer? [eos]
[sos] yes, i looked there, too. [eos]
[sos] don't we have about five sharpeners? [eos]
[sos] yes, but they seem to have legs. [eos]
[sos] tomorrow i'm going to buy an electric sharpener. [eos]
[sos] get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom. [eos]
[sos] yes. that way it will stay where i put it. [eos]
[sos] how are you doing that? [eos]
[sos] i started shopping at the dollar store. [eos]
[sos] that saves a lot of money. [eos]
[sos] i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar. [eos]
[sos] that's a good deal. [eos]
[sos] yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes. [eos]
[sos] just put them in the fridge. [eos]
[sos] also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee. [eos]
[sos] why did you do that? [eos]
[sos] i mixed them together. [eos]
[sos] if the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea. [eos]
[sos] can we afford it? [eos]
[sos] they want 20 percent down. [eos]
[sos] that's a lot of money. [eos]
[sos] but the house is so nice. [eos]
[sos] it's in a great neighborhood. [eos]
[sos] it's close to the beach. [eos]
[sos] it's close to the freeways. [eos]
[sos] it's got a big yard. [eos]
[sos] the kids love the house, too. [eos]
[sos] if we don't buy it, someone else will. [eos]
[sos] you're right. let's buy it now. we can worry later. [eos]
[sos] are you sure? [eos]
[sos] we will be house rich, but cash poor. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] our monthly payments will be too high. [eos]
[sos] we won't have any money for other things? [eos]
[sos] no, we won't have money for gas or food. [eos]
[sos] we'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches? [eos]
[sos] without the peanut butter! [eos]
[sos] that's no good! [eos]
[sos] we have to find a cheaper house. [eos]
[sos] of course. we can't live without gas or peanut butter. [eos]
[sos] i don't like it. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter with it? [eos]
[sos] it's on the corner. [eos]
[sos] so? [eos]
[sos] that means it gets twice as much traffic. [eos]
[sos] you're right. [eos]
[sos] when you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection. [eos]
[sos] or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop. [eos]
[sos] or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house. [eos]
[sos] let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end. [eos]
[sos] that's perfect. the less traffic, the better. [eos]
[sos] me, too. [eos]
[sos] we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on main street. [eos]
[sos] we'd better get ready to go. [eos]
[sos] it's an upstairs unit. [eos]
[sos] that's good, because i don't want to live under people with loud feet. [eos]
[sos] and it's a corner unit. [eos]
[sos] that's great. we won't have neighbors on both sides of us. [eos]
[sos] no pets are allowed. [eos]
[sos] perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs. [eos]
[sos] and there are only six units in the whole building. [eos]
[sos] where's the checkbook? i'm ready to rent it without even seeing it. [eos]
[sos] yes. he said he'd come over tomorrow. [eos]
[sos] did he say what time? [eos]
[sos] yes. he said he'd be here at 9 o'clock. [eos]
[sos] did he understand what the problem is? [eos]
[sos] yes. i told him our doorbell doesn't work. [eos]
[sos] it shouldn't take him long to fix it. [eos]
[sos] i don't even know why we need to fix it. [eos]
[sos] in case we have visitors. [eos]
[sos] but they can just knock on the door. [eos]
[sos] actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too. [eos]
[sos] yes, it would be nice if he'd give us a new carpet. [eos]
[sos] yes, it's beautiful. [eos]
[sos] it's perfect for us and the kids. [eos]
[sos] three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard. [eos]
[sos] and we can afford it! [eos]
[sos] so are we going to buy it? [eos]
[sos] i'm afraid not. [eos]
[sos] it's too far from your job, isn't it? [eos]
[sos] i can't spend four hours on the road every day. [eos]
[sos] by the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat. [eos]
[sos] i won't be able to play with the kids. [eos]
[sos] no, we have to find something closer to your job. [eos]
[sos] it sure is. [eos]
[sos] in fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too. [eos]
[sos] let's turn on the heat. [eos]
[sos] i'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut. [eos]
[sos] it should be warmer in a few minutes. [eos]
[sos] it's so nice to have a heated apartment. [eos]
[sos] how did they survive in the old days? [eos]
[sos] they had fireplaces. [eos]
[sos] someone had to chop the wood. [eos]
[sos] and carry it into the house. [eos]
[sos] all we have to do is flip a switch. [eos]
[sos] the streets are clean and quiet. [eos]
[sos] the neighbors don't party on the weekends. [eos]
[sos] people take care of their lawns. [eos]
[sos] no rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards. [eos]
[sos] we never have to call the police about anything. [eos]
[sos] our kids are completely safe. [eos]
[sos] so why are we selling our house? [eos]
[sos] they're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner. [eos]
[sos] so we've got to sell before property values go down? [eos]
[sos] yes. i still can't believe our city council allowed this building. [eos]
[sos] they're probably getting something under the table. [eos]
[sos] yes, it was. [eos]
[sos] they said about 30 houses burned to the ground. [eos]
[sos] and they were expensive houses. [eos]
[sos] i feel so sorry for those people. [eos]
[sos] why feel sorry for rich people? [eos]
[sos] i feel sorry for anyone who loses their home. [eos]
[sos] so do i, but not if they're rich. [eos]
[sos] what does that have to do with it? [eos]
[sos] rich people think they're better than us. [eos]
[sos] how many rich people do you know? [eos]
[sos] none. [eos]
[sos] of course they are. they're starving to death. [eos]
[sos] they should stay in the woods where they belong. [eos]
[sos] there's no food in the woods. [eos]
[sos] can't they eat grass? [eos]
[sos] do you think a bear is a cow? [eos]
[sos] well, i've seen them eating berries. [eos]
[sos] berries aren't in season all year round. [eos]
[sos] it's too dangerous for kids and pets. [eos]
[sos] people need to cover their trash cans. [eos]
[sos] the police need to shoot all the bears. [eos]
[sos] you don't solve a problem by shooting it. [eos]
[sos] i voted for obama. [eos]
[sos] me too. [eos]
[sos] he will be a great president. [eos]
[sos] everyone likes him. [eos]
[sos] he's a good speaker. [eos]
[sos] and he's really smart. [eos]
[sos] he will solve our problems. [eos]
[sos] he will end the war. [eos]
[sos] the next four years will be good years. [eos]
[sos] i'll vote for him next time, too. [eos]
[sos] i think everyone will. [eos]
[sos] who are you voting for? [eos]
[sos] i'm not voting for the mayor. [eos]
[sos] why not? [eos]
[sos] he made promises that he didn't keep. [eos]
[sos] like what? [eos]
[sos] he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers. [eos]
[sos] how many did he hire? [eos]
[sos] one hundred! [eos]
[sos] maybe he had a good reason. [eos]
[sos] maybe he's just a liar. [eos]
[sos] maybe i'll vote for someone else, too. [eos]
[sos] only 15 percent of the voters turned out. [eos]
[sos] that is a joke. [eos]
[sos] voting is so important, but people don't bother. [eos]
[sos] many people think their vote doesn't matter. [eos]
[sos] the mayor won by only 2,000 votes. [eos]
[sos] we're stuck with him for four more years. [eos]
[sos] voting is so easy. you can even mail your ballot in. [eos]
[sos] all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it. [eos]
[sos] how easy is that? [eos]
[sos] i guess people just don't care. [eos]
[sos] they'll care when they see their taxes go up. [eos]
[sos] but we have the same old problems. [eos]
[sos] well, he's made a few changes. [eos]
[sos] like what? [eos]
[sos] i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house. [eos]
[sos] oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court. [eos]
[sos] who's paying for that? [eos]
[sos] i think we are! [eos]
[sos] well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly. [eos]
[sos] yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly. [eos]
[sos] do any other world leaders have a basketball court? [eos]
[sos] they will. you know america always leads the way. [eos]
[sos] well, more than 50 million people voted for mccain. [eos]
[sos] that's 50 million people who don't love obama. [eos]
[sos] obama's got four years to make everyone happy. [eos]
[sos] he's never going to make everyone happy. [eos]
[sos] can you imagine being president? [eos]
[sos] everyone wants you to solve their problems. [eos]
[sos] i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems. [eos]
[sos] you and everybody else. [eos]
[sos] i would never want to be president. [eos]
[sos] but think about all the power you'd have. [eos]
[sos] i prefer my quiet little life to all the power in the world. [eos]
[sos] what article? [eos]
[sos] it says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties. [eos]
[sos] only 11 percent? [eos]
[sos] about 50 percent of the time he's traveling. [eos]
[sos] where does he travel to? [eos]
[sos] oh, all over the world. [eos]
[sos] but he's supposed to be making our city a better place. [eos]
[sos] he's visiting other cities to get ideas. [eos]
[sos] can't he just go online? [eos]
[sos] the rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection. [eos]
[sos] well, he'll never get reelected once this news gets out. [eos]
[sos] i voted for ralph nader. [eos]
[sos] who in the world is ralph nader? [eos]
[sos] he's the best man for president. [eos]
[sos] why's that? [eos]
[sos] he hates corporations. [eos]
[sos] well, most corporations do think only about money. [eos]
[sos] he hates democrats and republicans. [eos]
[sos] well, they do put their party before their country. [eos]
[sos] he's the only candidate that i trust. [eos]
[sos] but he didn't have a chance. nobody voted for him! [eos]
[sos] sooner or later, voters will wake up. [eos]
[sos] why's that? [eos]
[sos] what good does it do? [eos]
[sos] you get to put someone in power that you like. [eos]
[sos] only if my candidate wins. [eos]
[sos] well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him. [eos]
[sos] but even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises. [eos]
[sos] that's true. they promise anything just so they get elected. [eos]
[sos] and when elected, they go their own way. [eos]
[sos] they forget who put them in power. [eos]
[sos] they forget where they came from. [eos]
[sos] maybe you should run for office. [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] there were more votes than voters! [eos]
[sos] but that's impossible. [eos]
[sos] officials said that it's possible. [eos]
[sos] did they explain how it's possible? [eos]
[sos] no. they said there are some things you can't explain. [eos]
[sos] so are they going to hold another election? [eos]
[sos] no. that will cost too much money. [eos]
[sos] so it's better to save money than to have an honest election? [eos]
[sos] well, the democratic party says it was an honest election. [eos]
[sos] of course they say thattheir man won! [eos]
[sos] yes. he's telling jokes about his eight years as president. [eos]
[sos] yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone. [eos]
[sos] only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas. [eos]
[sos] not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers. [eos]
[sos] but bush visited some of them in the hospital once. [eos]
[sos] that's nice that he found the time to make a visit. [eos]
[sos] he spoke to them and made them feel better. [eos]
[sos] did he speak to every family that lost a soldier? [eos]
[sos] no, he didn't have time to do that. [eos]
[sos] well, he's got plenty of time now! [eos]
[sos] no, he's too busy writing a book about how hard it was to be president. [eos]
[sos] yes, with the voter instructions. [eos]
[sos] how are you going to vote? [eos]
[sos] same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp. [eos]
[sos] i meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes? [eos]
[sos] against all of them, of course. [eos]
[sos] but we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons. [eos]
[sos] we've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff! [eos]
[sos] that's true. where did that money go? [eos]
[sos] our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world. [eos]
[sos] they are having a good time with our money. [eos]
[sos] so when are we going to stop giving them more? [eos]
[sos] do you mean on measures 1, 2, and 3? [eos]
[sos] yes. the ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals. [eos]
[sos] you mean the measures that will raise our taxes. [eos]
[sos] but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase. [eos]
[sos] do you believe the tv ads? [eos]
[sos] i like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes. [eos]
[sos] don't believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you, the opposite is true. [eos]
[sos] but the title of measure 1 is "better schools at no cost." [eos]
[sos] the title should be "better schools at huge cost." [eos]
[sos] i can't believe that they would lie to us. [eos]
[sos] of course they liethat's what politicians do! [eos]
[sos] is it something you ate? [eos]
[sos] maybe. i'm not sure. [eos]
[sos] what did you have for breakfast? [eos]
[sos] the usual, cereal with milk and a banana. [eos]
[sos] maybe the milk was bad. [eos]
[sos] it didn't smell bad. [eos]
[sos] maybe the banana was bad. [eos]
[sos] no, the banana was delicious. [eos]
[sos] maybe you just need to go to the bathroom. [eos]
[sos] no, that's not the problem. [eos]
[sos] maybe it will go away in a little while. [eos]
[sos] i don't know. [eos]
[sos] it looks like blood. [eos]
[sos] i think my nose was bleeding. [eos]
[sos] you should wet your shirt immediately. [eos]
[sos] why? [eos]
[sos] because that gets the blood out of the shirt. [eos]
[sos] what's a little blood? [eos]
[sos] your white shirt is ruined. [eos]
[sos] so, i'll just buy another one. [eos]
[sos] you can wear this one around the house. [eos]
[sos] next time i'll soak it immediately. [eos]
[sos] why do they hurt? [eos]
[sos] i type too much. [eos]
[sos] you should take a break. [eos]
[sos] i need to type to make money. [eos]
[sos] but typing is causing you pain. [eos]
[sos] maybe i should see a doctor. [eos]
[sos] doctors are too expensive. [eos]
[sos] he might tell me to rest for a while. [eos]
[sos] he might want to cut you open. [eos]
[sos] he might say i'm okay. [eos]
[sos] he might say you have bone cancer. [eos]
[sos] he thinks i have too much stress. [eos]
[sos] stress causes your stomachaches? [eos]
[sos] stress causes different problems with different people. [eos]
[sos] so what did he tell you to do? [eos]
[sos] he said i need to think positive. [eos]
[sos] he didn't give you any medication? [eos]
[sos] i hate medication. it makes me feel different. [eos]
[sos] so how do you think positive? [eos]
[sos] i think about nice things. [eos]
[sos] like what? [eos]
[sos] like a day at the beach, with my toes in the sand. [eos]
[sos] how did you do that? [eos]
[sos] it's a paper cut. [eos]
[sos] paper can be dangerous. [eos]
[sos] it hurts, too. [eos]
[sos] paper cuts can hurt a lot. [eos]
[sos] where are the band-aids? [eos]
[sos] i think they're in the medicine cabinet. [eos]
[sos] it's on the tip of my finger. [eos]
[sos] a band-aid might not work. [eos]
[sos] i must not use this finger until the cut heals. [eos]
[sos] it might take a day or two to heal. [eos]
[sos] oh, yes. [eos]
[sos] i can't stand cigarette smoke. [eos]
[sos] it smells so bad. [eos]
[sos] one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk. [eos]
[sos] smokers think they are so cool. [eos]
[sos] they are so weak. [eos]
[sos] a little cigarette controls them. [eos]
[sos] they look so stupid taking a puff. [eos]
[sos] and then they blow smoke out of their mouth. [eos]
[sos] they think it's cool. [eos]
[sos] cigarettes stink. [eos]
[sos] yes, i do. [eos]
[sos] how did you get it? [eos]
[sos] my sister had a cold. she gave it to me. [eos]
[sos] have you taken anything for your cold? [eos]
[sos] no, i just blow my nose a lot. [eos]
[sos] your nose is stopped up? [eos]
[sos] yes. i have to breathe through my mouth. [eos]
[sos] have you tried nose drops? [eos]
[sos] no, i don't like nose drops. [eos]
[sos] they work great. [eos]
[sos] i don't care. i don't like to put drops in my nose. [eos]
[sos] sure. [eos]
[sos] thank you. [eos]
[sos] you shouldn't lie in the sun for too long. [eos]
[sos] i want to get a tan. i don't want to look so pale. [eos]
[sos] what's wrong with looking pale? [eos]
[sos] people think you might be sick. [eos]
[sos] who thinks that? [eos]
[sos] i don't know. [eos]
[sos] it's better to be pale than to have skin cancer. [eos]
[sos] i know that. [eos]
[sos] so why are you arguing with me? don't lie in the sun too long! [eos]
[sos] of course you can. [eos]
[sos] i don't have enough will power. [eos]
[sos] of course you do. [eos]
[sos] i wish i had never started. [eos]
[sos] so does every smoker. [eos]
[sos] i've tried to quit so many times. [eos]
[sos] so has everyone else. [eos]
[sos] nothing seems to work. [eos]
[sos] all it takes is will power, and you have it. [eos]
[sos] then why can't i quit? [eos]
[sos] you have to believe in yourself. [eos]
[sos] what did you do? [eos]
[sos] i got out of my car. [eos]
[sos] that's it? [eos]
[sos] i injured my back one time just by sneezing. [eos]
[sos] you should see a doctor. [eos]
[sos] my doctor said i need surgery. [eos]
[sos] so? [eos]
[sos] so, forget it. [eos]
[sos] you don't have the money? [eos]
[sos] i have no insurance. [eos]
[sos] maybe a back rub would help. [eos]
[sos] three packs of what? [eos]
[sos] cigarettes, of course. [eos]
[sos] how can he do that? [eos]
[sos] when he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another. [eos]
[sos] he's a chain smoker. [eos]
[sos] he's been a chain smoker for 30 years. [eos]
[sos] that's unbelievable. can he still breathe? [eos]
[sos] he can, but the people around him can't. [eos]
[sos] how can he still be alive? [eos]
[sos] his doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy. [eos]
[sos] maybe i should start smoking. [eos]
[sos] it's such a chore. [eos]
[sos] brush, brush. spit, spit. [eos]
[sos] what did they do in the old days? [eos]
[sos] they brushed with their fingers. [eos]
[sos] they also ate with their fingers! [eos]
[sos] why do they call it the good old days? [eos]
[sos] maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss. [eos]
[sos] who invented flossing? [eos]
[sos] a dentist, i'm sure. [eos]
[sos] i hate flossing more than brushing! [eos]
[sos] i can't wait till all my teeth fall out. [eos]
[sos] this trail is hard to climb. [eos]
[sos] especially on a hot day like this. [eos]
[sos] i can't believe we haven't seen any animals. [eos]
[sos] thank goodness! i don't want to see any wild animals. [eos]
[sos] all we've seen so far is a couple of lizards. [eos]
[sos] we're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears. [eos]
[sos] i bet i've lost a couple of pounds already. [eos]
[sos] all you've lost is some sweat. [eos]
[sos] i haven't even lost one pound of fat? [eos]
[sos] if you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day. [eos]
[sos] okay, but let's hike in town. at least there are cats and dogs to see. [eos]
[sos] pimples suck. [eos]
[sos] it seems like i get a new pimple almost every day. [eos]
[sos] maybe it's something in your diet. [eos]
[sos] no, i eat the same things day after day. [eos]
[sos] then maybe it's in your genes. [eos]
[sos] you might be right. [eos]
[sos] do pimples run in your family? [eos]
[sos] not that i've noticed. [eos]
[sos] well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air. [eos]
[sos] whatever the cause, i hate seeing them on my face. [eos]
[sos] well, on the bright side, they're fun to pop. [eos]
[sos] i don't believe anything i don't see with my own eyes. [eos]
[sos] you can't believe what you hear on tv or radio. [eos]
[sos] you can't believe what you read in the newspapers. [eos]
[sos] everyone tells you a different story about the same thing. [eos]
[sos] three different people will give you three different stories. [eos]
[sos] and the government will give you a fourth story. [eos]
[sos] yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu. [eos]
[sos] but the swine flu just killed 20 people in mexico. [eos]
[sos] the government says we have nothing to worry about. [eos]
[sos] then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home? [eos]
[sos] the government says to wash our hands frequently, and we'll all be okay. [eos]
[sos] i wasn't picking my nose. [eos]
[sos] what were you doing? [eos]
[sos] i was scratching my nose. [eos]
[sos] i think i know the difference between picking and scratching. [eos]
[sos] okay, mom, maybe i was picking it a little bit. [eos]
[sos] use a tissue next time. [eos]
[sos] i didn't have a tissue. [eos]
[sos] then wait till you find a tissue. [eos]
[sos] i couldn't wait. it was an emergency. [eos]
[sos] oh, really? maybe you should have called 911. [eos]
[sos] it wasn't that kind of emergency. [eos]
[sos] yes, it's covered with crud. [eos]
[sos] i'm going to clean it. [eos]
[sos] don't use water on it! [eos]
[sos] i'll use a damp cloth. [eos]
[sos] don't let water get into any of the cracks. [eos]
[sos] i'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry. [eos]
[sos] don't rub the numbers off the remote. [eos]
[sos] i will rub gently but firmly. [eos]
[sos] do it quickly, please, so i can change channels during commercials. [eos]
[sos] i'll give it back to you in a couple of minutes. [eos]
[sos] maybe we should put it in a plastic bag to keep it clean. [eos]
[sos] what's the matter? [eos]
[sos] i was on a plane. [eos]
[sos] so? [eos]
[sos] so, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt. [eos]
[sos] that's no good. [eos]
[sos] sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't. [eos]
[sos] have you seen a doctor? [eos]
[sos] i've been to two doctors. [eos]
[sos] and they couldn't fix your problem? [eos]
[sos] they both said i have to live with it. [eos]
[sos] or you can stay off planes. [eos]
[sos] did she get a nice job? [eos]
[sos] she got an "everything" job! [eos]
[sos] what do you mean? [eos]
[sos] a team of doctors gave her a whole new face. [eos]
[sos] why did they do that? [eos]
[sos] a mad dog bit most of her face off. [eos]
[sos] oh, that's terrible. what does she look like now? [eos]
[sos] her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down. [eos]
[sos] and then will she look normal again? [eos]
[sos] i guess so. [eos]
[sos] god bless modern medicine. [eos]
[sos] what's wrong with it? [eos]
[sos] it aches most of the time. [eos]
[sos] what do you think it is? [eos]
[sos] i don't know. i think it's old age. [eos]
[sos] if it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt? [eos]
[sos] that's a good question. maybe it's not old age. [eos]
[sos] are you right-handed? [eos]
[sos] yes. all my life. [eos]
[sos] you're wearing out your right hand. stop using it so much. [eos]
[sos] but i do all my writing with my right hand. [eos]
[sos] start typing instead. that way your left hand will do half the work. [eos]
[sos] hello! how's your day going? [eos]
[sos] it's going well, thanks. and yours? [eos]
[sos] not too bad, just keeping busy. [eos]
[sos] what have you been up to? [eos]
[sos] just working on a few projects. [eos]
[sos] oh, sounds interesting. what kind of projects? [eos]

[sos] that sounds like a lot of fun. What games did you play? [eos]
[sos] We played board games and a few outdoor sports. [eos]
[sos] sounds like a blast. Did you win any of the games? [eos]
[sos] Not really. We all had a good time though. [eos]
[sos] that's what matters most. Did you do anything else? [eos]
[sos] Just some relaxing and catching up on reading. [eos]
[sos] nice way to unwind. What book are you reading? [eos]

[sos] that sounds interesting. What stage are you at? [eos]
[sos] I'm currently working on the testing phase. [eos]

[sos] Yum! How did it turn out? [eos]
[sos] It turned out delicious! Everyone enjoyed it. [eos]
[sos] That’s awesome. Cooking for others must be rewarding. [eos]
[sos] Definitely! It’s always nice to see people enjoy your food. [eos]
[sos] Absolutely. Do you like to bake as well? [eos]
[sos] Yes, I enjoy baking cookies and cakes. [eos]
[sos] That sounds fun. What’s your favorite thing to bake? [eos]

[sos] Great choice! Do you make your own cheesecake? [eos]
[sos] I do, sometimes. It’s fun to experiment with flavors. [eos]
[sos] That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you have any special recipes? [eos]
[sos] Yes, I have a recipe for strawberry cheesecake that’s a hit. [eos]
[sos] That sounds amazing. I might have to try making that. [eos]
[sos] You should! It’s quite delicious. [eos]
[sos] I’ll definitely consider it. Thanks for the tip! [eos]
[sos] No problem. Let me know how it turns out! [eos]
[sos] I will. Have you tried making any new dishes recently? [eos]
[sos] Yes, I recently tried making sushi at home. [eos]
[sos] How was that? Making sushi sounds challenging. [eos]
[sos] It was a bit tricky, but it turned out great. [eos]
[sos] That’s impressive! I bet it tasted amazing. [eos]
[sos] It did! It was worth the effort. [eos]
[sos] I’ll have to try making sushi sometime. Any tips for beginners? [eos]
[sos] Start with simple rolls and use good quality ingredients. [eos]
[sos] Good advice. I’ll keep that in mind. [eos]
[sos] Glad to help! Do you like to travel? [eos]
[sos] I do! I love exploring new places and cultures. [eos]
[sos] That’s great. What’s your favorite travel destination? [eos]
[sos] I’d have to say Japan. The culture and food are amazing. [eos]
[sos] Japan sounds incredible. What did you enjoy most about it? [eos]
[sos] The cherry blossoms in spring and the food, especially sushi! [eos]
[sos] Cherry blossoms must be beautiful. Did you visit during the festival? [eos]
[sos] Yes, I visited during sakura season. It was magical. [eos]
[sos] I can imagine! Japan sounds like a dream destination. [eos]
[sos] It really is. Do you have any dream travel destinations? [eos]
[sos] I’d love to visit Italy someday. The history and cuisine are fascinating. [eos]
[sos] Italy is amazing. I hope you get to visit soon. [eos]
[sos] Thank you! I hope so too. Do you have any other travel plans? [eos]
[sos] Not right now, but I’m thinking of planning a road trip. [eos]
[sos] A road trip sounds like an adventure. Where are you thinking of going? [eos]
[sos] I’m considering a trip along the Pacific Coast Highway. [eos]
[sos] That’s a beautiful drive. You’ll see some amazing scenery. [eos]
[sos] I’m excited about it! I’ve heard the views are breathtaking. [eos]
[sos] They definitely are. Make sure to stop at the viewpoints. [eos]
[sos] I will! Thanks for the advice. [eos]
[sos] You’re welcome. I hope you have a fantastic trip. [eos]
[sos] Thanks! I’ll share my experience with you when I get back. [eos]

[sos] thanks, you too! [eos]
[sos] bye! [eos]
